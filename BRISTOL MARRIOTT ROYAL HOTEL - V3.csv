"Great location where you could easily access to city centre and riverside. A classic hotel with onsite parking (£17 per day) was good. Room size for 4 occupants was not bad, clean and tidy. Unfortunately, only free wifi was available in public areas."
"On arrival we realised that the room didn’t have everything listed in the online description. There were no bedside sockets, no seating area and no alarm clock. There was also only one bedside table for 4 occupants. It was like half the furniture in the room had been removed. Whilst bathing our children we also discovered that the shampoo dispenser had not been refilled and was completely empty.  The next morning, I requested that these be resolved, partly expecting to be offered a different room but instead I was told that the furniture would be sorted out, we would be given an extension cable for the sockets, an alarm clock would be provided and the shampoo would be refilled.  When we arrived that evening, the ‘seating area’ turned out to be a single dining chair, no extension"
"We stay here a lot and the hotel is usually always clean and tidy, occasionally the cleaning seems to just get forgotten but the bedding, towels and service are usually always top notch, the staff really are super helpful, the M&C restaurant really is fab too, especially their wonderful Portuguese waiter, Victor Martins! We absolutely love Portugal and  we're due to return for a short break and he really went out of his way to tell us about great places to visit, impart lots of his wine and food  knowledge, and really took his time explaining things, he also went through the menu with us and recommended some really great food and it was all delivered with a super attitude- this guy really is an asset to this restaurant and really made our experience from something of a late"
"Fantastic  I would recommend this hotel to anyone. From reception through the room, we had a stay that will stay in our memories. I messed up our booking, but skim on reception sorted it out, smiling all the time. All the staff were welcoming, it made for a great atmosphere "
"Very aggravating trying to get Reception to answer the phone as we had some questions ahead of our stay. On the sixth occasion, thankfully, someone did.  Slept well in comfortable bed and bedding.  But, generally, showing signs of tiredness and rather expensive in context"
"Worth the money. The whole experience was top notch. From checking in to the gym, the restaurant and breakfast. Ok you have to pay to park but it’s not expensive and is convenient. They say 24hours but it ran up to midnight after we checked out so gave us the day to shop."
"A really nice Hotel with excellent staff overall. The bar staff are really good and knowledgeable with cocktails and drinks and nothing was too much trouble.  We didn't eat in the restaurant apart from breakfast and as a group of eight wanted to sit as a group in the morning and despite requesting this the day we got a lot of frowning, reluctance and ""huffiness"" from one particular staff member, so we just moved table together ourselves and had a nice breakfast!"
Great location.  Staff were fabulous. My husband wanted to change the room and they were very accommodating.  Car parking was easy and again staff were very helpful. Breakfast was a treat and the staff in the dining room were very attentive. I will definitely book again and recommend. All the comfort in old fashioned British style. 
"Friendly welcoming to the hotel, clean tidy reception area, miller and carter on site with nice bar area.  Room clean and tidy. Comfortable bed. Great access to the city centre all within walking distance allowing the car to be left in the car park below the hotel, however limited security within the car park, sadly our car was ransacked during our stay :( only to be discovered upon leaving the hotel, unfortunately we were not the only ones at the desk at this time reporting this. Upon reporting this to reception they were apologetic and I was informed this wasn’t the first time recently therefore I would suggest if you are parking here to remove anything and everything from your vehicles!! - the car was locked when we left it luckily for us nothing of value was actually inside."
"Had an omelette for breakfast cooked by Nawas. A lovely omelette, excellent customer service from  Nawas. Would highly recommend, a good selection choice for breakfast. All the staff were lovely and the restaurant was clean and tidy "
"The room door was left open and on the latch by housekeeping for multiple hours, when I returned after 6 hours walking around Bristol. Complained to the front desk livid, but nobody seemed to care. Zero apology, zero recognition of their mistake, and zero understanding of the security implications. I was told they thought they knew who had done it from housekeeping and they would get back to me with an explanation. Still waiting 7 days later."
"Upon booking in the reception staff were both polite and very helpful, especially it being our first time at the Royal Hotel. We were informed of the car parking and how we could get to our room. The room was very clean and tidy and a nice touch on the TV was our details and bill info. We attended 50th birthday party and the food that we all ordered was exceptional value to money but above up the quality of the food was first class. Everyone who attended all remarked how good the food was. The stay at the Royal hotel Bristol will be go down as one of the best hotels we have stayed in the UK.  "
Booked direct for my 60th birthday celebrations. Was given a room upgrade which included  a bottle of champagne and chocolates - a very generous birthday treat. Hotel great location with very good breakfast options. A five star stay.
"I booked this hotel for a weekend stay, whilst I was attending a HiFi show in the city. I had left it a little late to book accommodation, but I am pleased to say that my stay at this hotel was fabulous. The room was very comfortable and spacious with an excellent shower room. The Miller and Carter restaurant was very busy on the night, but despite travelling on my own they managed to find me a table. The food was excellent and reasonably priced.  I would definitely stay at the hotel again, the next time I am in Bristol, and would definitely stay in a Marriott hotel again in the future, if this is an example of what to expect."
"Hotel ambience on entrance is lovely. Very grand reception area. Lots of good points noted throughout the stay and the staff are welcoming, friendly and attentive.  A few improvements....  Breakfast is a bun fight (quite literally).  Greeted by a friendly person, but I think long hair should be tied back when working in or around food delivery areas.  There's no system in place or order to breakfast stations so it's full of people going back and forward and clamouring for their choices. A one way system or signage would help this. For instance there are plates at either end of the hot servery which is confusing. Sauces available at one end only which is awkward.   The bowls for breakfast cereal and yogurt having been recently washed were roasting hot.   The shower screen did not"
"Booked 2 rooms 1 for myself and another for my sister for my birthday weekend to celebrate with old colleagues, the staff went above and beyond my daughter who had booked for me obviously told them about my birthday and they had decorated my room, left me a birthday card and a bottle of wine such a lovely gesture x great Location great room and fantastic staff thanks so much for making my weekend special x will be back next year (if I'm still alive 😀)"
"Stayed here for one night, but unfortunately it was not overly comfortable. On the positive side the room was spacious, with complimentary waters and toiletries ( although I don’t favour the refillable ones, as previous guests could tamper with them). The location is great, near the theatre, lovely restaurants and bars and the aquarium and harbour. Unfortunately the bathroom was tiny (especially for 4 guests) with little vanity space and stiff, thin towels. The duvets were wafer thin too, so we were cold in the night and kept waking up. There was a beeping in the corridor too which kept us awake until Reception were called to sort it out. Breakfast was busy but well stocked with fresh items. The system however is strange. I wanted to order a porridge and so was directed to the"
Hotel was spot on  Good staff and service Great food Great location Ideal for me and my family to meet up I recommend this Hotel because it’s right by The Quay where all the bards an Restraunts are also there’s a GOOD Restraunt in the Hotel a MILLER & CARTER lovely to 
I stayed in a superior room in the Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel. The staff were courteous and very helpful. The room was a good size and very clean with a king size bed. It was also very quiet. The bathroom was also large and very clean. I ordered breakfast to be brought to my room. It arrived on time and was very good. I shall certainly stay there again.
"I stayed one night with my family in two rooms. For such a grand old building one can see that the team are around the clock maintaining it to a high standard. The rooms were all clean with latest screen TV's and electric sockets. Reception were plentiful, friendly and 24/7. Highly recommend this Hotel"
"Another fabulous stay at this gorgeous hotel. The ladies on reception were so efficient and lovely - they were very accommodating trying to find us the perfect family room for us. We had a great view over College Green and our room was lovely. So clean and well equipped. The breakfast was great too, we got a table in the morning overlooking the cathedral both days, food selection great. We love the hotel lounge areas and the gym was great too - so clean and well equipped. We will definitely return as it’s my favourite hotel, been coming here for 20 years! Great that breakfast served until late and that check out is 12 too, you don’t feel too rushed. "
"I recently stayed one night at the Marriott Royal whilst on business in Bristol.  My room was large, and contained two beds, and there were all the usual amenities eg TV, free wi-fi, tea/coffee & biscuits, iron etc and the bathroom was clean and bright. Unfortunately, it wasn't possible to open the window to get some fresh air into the room.  Check in took around 20 minutes as I seemed to have arrived at the same time as a number of others, but check-out in the morning was very quick.  The charge for the car-park was £17 and the parking bay were narrow. However, was the first level was busy, the level below was virtually empty so it was easy to park there.  I didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that, and I have separately reviewed the restaurant"
"We stayed for a night to attend our sons graduation. The hotel was lovely and our room was large, clean and had everything a guest could need, toiletries, coffee, teas, fridge etc... The bed was comfy and the room was quiet at night (always a bonus!) Bristol is extremely big and busy and the hotel felt very calm and relaxing.  Check in was easy and there is plenty of room in the safe underground car park (£17 per night for hotel guests) The lady on reception was very friendly. The only thing that let the stay down was the Miller and Carter restaurant. They were very understaffed and our meal for 4 people took 3 hours as service between courses was virtually non existent and relied upon us keep searching out staff! All the guests around us were having to do the same thing. When"
"This is a large, comfortable hotel in an interesting building with good staff, but I feel it is not making the most of its best assets. First, the room. This was fine, with with a good bed and bathroom, very clean, all the usual facilities, though a frankly horrible painting of a trumpeter on the wall did nothing to improve the rather grey decor. More importantly, the bedroom window was sealed shut. So there was no way to ventilate the room. Surely the pandemic should have made hotels aware of the crucial importance of fresh air - closed internal ventilation systems are not enough. And apart from the health aspect, most people want to be able to open their own window!  Second, the Palm Court on the ground floor. This is a huge, exceptionally beautiful space stretching up three"
"The Marriott Royal has held a special place in our heart for over a decade.  We were married here, we held my mums 60th birthday here and it is (was) our go to hotel.   We don’t get many nights away now as our daughter is disabled and arranging overnight respite care is extremely difficult.  This is why when we do go away we like to go somewhere luxurious.  Unfortunately the Marriott is slowly stripping the luxury away. We were so excited for our stay, we were looking forward to using the pool and the spa area but alas it is no more.  Just an extended gym.   This really disappointed us.    The rooms have supposedly been refurbished but this just means a lick of paint. The furniture is the same chipped and dated mahogany furniture that has been there for over 12 years.   The"
"Staff friendly, breakfast was good Bathroom floor was dirty and shower needed a clean. Used cups not changed.   Noise coming from guests at 2am who were using terrace - need to close this off so rooms facing terrace do not hear people there ( after midnight)"
"We had yet another fantastic stay at this lovely hotel.  On arrival the staff are welcoming, friendly, polite and efficient.  We were quickly ushered to reception and although we arrived early they checked if our room was ready.   It was not but it was no problem to leave our luggage and go into the city.    The room was immaculate,  and all facilities were available and working.  The bed was extremely comfortable and it was easy to serve the room environment to where we wanted it to be for us.  The bar facilities were great and in the morning the  breakfast was great.  Check out was fast and easy.    All I'm all an excellent stay.  We are looking forward to returning in March.  "
"From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so incredibly welcome by the staff at reception. The whole ambience and decor of the hotel was impressive and we were delighted to find a room larger than we expected, and equally as well decorated as the main parts of the hotel. We had drinks at the bar before eating at Miller & Carter (where again we received excellent service) and enjoyed breakfast in bed the following morning – a real treat. We would highly recommend staying here. The location is central and perfect for exploring many parts of the city, and the whole stay was excellent value for money."
"I stayed at this hotel during my wife's birthday. The staff were really friendly and helpful, a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates were sent to our room on arrival with a lovely birthday card. The restaurant and the food were superb. The bar staff were very accommodating and friendly. We had excellent room service and a truly wonderful stay. We will certainly stay at this hotel again next time we visit Bristol because of its grand interior, location to the waterfront and city centre. Strongly recommended."
"Hotel was ok wasn’t great,  but wasn’t particularly bad but felt dated.   We had to check out of the hotel a hour after we checked in as my pregnant wife wasn’t feeling well unfortunately.  Absolutely no fault of the hotels and I didn’t expect a refund or anything in return but as I explained to women who seemed to be in charge behind reception ( dark hair lady, noticeably older lady than the rest) she just grabbed my key card and said “ok fine”and walked away didn’t even make eye contact with me. She came across very rude   Would I stay here again or recommend it ? - No"
"Great weekend at this lovely historic hotel, if you are a light sleeper ask for a quiet room, I’m so glad we did because you could still hear the night life going on not far from here with all the pubs, bars clubs around the harbour area. However it wasn’t too bad and if you shut the window it takes away y the noise. Our room was really spacious and as I was with my Son we had a double bed each, really comfy, lovely pillows and bedding,the room over looked a courtyard. There is a coffee machine with pods if you like coffee, everything you need in your room. Ironing board, hairdryer, plenty of towels. The bathroom could do with another rail and more hooks to hang the wet towels and even better would be a heated towel rail, the bathroom was a bit cold for me. I found the decor a"
"Impressive building inside and out. Overall impression was clean and well maintained.  Great location for the theatre and town for the shops.     We had a slow check in with different fire alarms sounding. However these things happen and the check in team were efficient as they could of been.   The room was standard,  clean and had everything you needed. A good size. Again immaculately clean.  The house keeping team are obviously exceptional.   What did let the stay down was the bar area sat 14th approx 5pm. It was untidy, empty glasses all over the bar and tables not in order.  We took seats at the bar around the amidst dirty coffee cups and glasses and fruit in bowls left to get warm. I wanted a blue lagoon cocktail but they did not have this nor could they think of something"
"We were a bit reticent about staying here due to recent reviews, however the room was great, clean and everything worked, free wifi as Bonvoy members. Checking in was quick and easy, good secure parking under the Hotel (No electric  chargers though). We had drinks in the bar in the afternoon, that was quiet and very pleasant. in the evening we ate in Miller and Carter, they had some staff who didn't turn up, however the food (Rump steaks I recommend) were first rate and the service from all staff was excellent as well. Breakfast was good also, good selection and hot food , was hot! Overall a fantastic experience all around , and we will definitely stay here again."
This is an exquisitely beautiful historic building with the benefit of modern design and luxury. My elderly mum in law and I spent 3 nights over Christmas 2022 here and we had the most wonderful caring service from the staff. Especially the wonderful Marewan on reception who came to our assistance several times at all times of the day and night. I’m disabled and MIL is frail and his kindness and support made our stay safe comfortable and special. A special touch was being presented with a cute teddy bear and a Christmas stocking filled with sweets and novelties on Christmas morning. This is a wonderful place and the only place I ever stay when visiting Bristol. 
"The Marriot gave us a lovely welcome. Our room was OK - it smelt a bit Shake & Vac, but we weren't in it much, so no big problems really. There are coffee pods and tea making facilities. Comfy bed and nice toiletries.  The restaurant is a Miller and Carter and is absolutely fine, both for main meals (if you are a red wine drinker, the Malbec is very good). and for breakfast. Good coffee too - always welcome for us. Friendly and efficient staff.   I'm Coeliac and I was very well looked after indeed. We were happy and we'd stay there again."
"Beautiful classy hotel.  Really nice.  Amazing location.  Parking is perfect, safe and £17 per 24 hours.  Breakfast is amazing and worth the money. Rooms are nice, lovley bathroom. Nice bar. I’ll be back. Close to all the bars, restaurants and water front."
"Positives - Great location - Lovely building  Negatives  - No free wifi, with the price that is paid to stay here you would at least expect free wifi throughout the hotel - Water was only lukewarm in shower"
"Our favourite hotel in Bristol, excellent as always.  Only disappointment they do not do a Bloody Mary, no tomato juice or Worcestershire Sauce. Will forgive them that.  Rooms and service excellent as always.  Perfect for the city centre. Extra cost for parking is expensive, but without it parking in Bristol is difficult."
"Stayed one night in what was supposed to be a family suite. It was actually 2 double beds wedged together - without bedside tables which meant books, phones etc had to be put on the floor. The room was tired and in need of modernisation and redecoration (scuffed walls and skirting and mould on the bathroom sealant). Also the windows were dirty and there was quite a bit of dust on surfaces. In terms of value etc it was poor. Not impressed and would not return."
"One night stay while at the Hippodrome which is virtually next door. Booked a double room suite which was brilliant! Quiet and spacious. Hotel itself was excellent, staff very good and really good breakfast. Wish we had been staying longer, Highly recommended."
"Clean and good service but the overall decoration is a bit tired.  An overhaul for modernisation is rather needed.  It was a 6 nights stay.   We paid premium towards the space and the convenience of this hotel, being in the city center.     Initially on the low floor and the smell from the kitchen was a true nuisance.  Hotel staff helpfully relocated us to other rooms on high floor once alternative rooms became available (after spending 4 nights, with 2 more to go).  An interesting point noted though is the inconsistency of decoration in the same type of room (we literally moved two flights up).  One bathroom had its toilet roll rack missing ..."
"This hotel had the best car park of which you can come and go as many times as you like and you can access the hotel directly from the car park in the lift  Not many places in Bristol have this facility so certainly worth the £17 fee to park  Beautiful interior everywhere and classy and clean  We were upgraded to a junior suite as it was a special occasion and the room was amazing  Lots of space, a sofa and 2 comfy chairs  A huge bed with a stand out ceiling feature which was very unusual All around large windows with great views of the harbour  Huge bathroom with lovely lighting and large bath and shower with 2 seperate heads  Complimentary wine and chocolates waiting for us  Large tv and a dresser with a large mirror  Would highly recommend and we will stay again  The room"
"Stayed here for a work event. Finally got the opportunity to stay myself as I’m always booking for others to stay here for work. Beautiful hotel right in the heart of Bristol. Hotel check in was courteous and staff very friendly. Nothing was too much trouble.  Hotel decor is a mixture of elegance with modern graffiti art prints dotted around.   Bar staff were great as well.  My room was on the 4th floor - and a very good size. Bathroom and shower were a good size and had plenty of hot water. Shampoo, conditioner and shower gel all provided for you and a good brand - The Works. Tea, coffee, water all in the room and all of good quality. Lifts were all light and bright and quick to get you to your floors.   Breakfast was great - everything and anything to suit all tastebuds.  Car"
"Used the hotel car park (spaces are small for a larger car!), route to reception was clearly signposted and then quick check in and up to our room on the 4th floor. Room felt warm and inviting. Tiny housekeeping issue, which they resolved immediately. Had an evening meal away from the hotel (have previously eaten at Miller and Carter here which was very good). Returned to the room which was quiet despite a lot of noise outside (it was halloween) and had a good nights sleep in a very comfortable bed. Bathroom was good, plenty of hot water although shower maybe lacked a little pressure. Had breakfast delivered to the room - it was spot on time, delicious, still hot and so much of it! Genuinely felt sad that we had only stayed one night and had to leave and go to work. Cannot wait"
"Perfect location for restaurants shops, riverside. Comfortable clean room, beautiful luxury hotel decor, helpful staff.  All of this at a great price, excellent value for money, highly recommend.   Car park £17 from arrival until midnight next day."
"One night stay following a visit to Bristol Hippodrome.   1. Fantastic location for the hippodrome Elsa than 5 minute walk 2. City centre parking - challenging to find if you hadn’t read previous reviews. If looking directly at the hotel the car park is to the left, through an arch. Don’t pay prices within the car park as this is charged to room and discounted to £16 for overnight compared to the advertised price of £34 3. Miller and Carter restaurant on site! 4. The hotel had amazing decor. The room themselves were modern. Water and coffee in the room. Also made use of the iron and ironing board. The only negative were the noisy neighbours 5. Breakfast - self service buffet English breakfast and continental. Only downside was the wait for coffee, I’d almost finished my"
"Beautiful hotel, clean rooms. Lovely staff. Perfect location. Gave our kids a Marriott activity pack and teddy upon arrival, food and drinks excellent. Will definitely return. Thank you for a great stay."
I’m always made to feel welcome at the Royal.  hotel .  The rooms have all been renovated and are very comfortable . The front office staff are always helpful and friendly . The hotel is very well located.   I will be back soon.  
"I had the unfortunate cause of needing to come to Bristol to visit my daughter who had unexpectedly been admitted to hospital. I booked one night, with the expectation that she would be discharged the next day. This sadly did not happen, nor the next day nor the next... Kim on reception was absolutely wonderful. Each day she arranged for me to keep the same room, with a late check out of 4pm at no extra charge. She was efficient, empathetic, warm and genuinely concerned for my daughter’s health. She really made a horrible situation so much more bearable. Nothing was too much trouble. The housekeeping staff were also amazing- as I was unsure if I would be staying or going for a few days, they made up my room for me on demand, at varying times of the day. I have to say this was"
"My husband and I stayed for one night on October 8th, and it was in all honesty the best night stay we have had in a hotel in the UK to date.  It was absolutely Faultless, the parking was great, the reception staff very friendly, the decor was perfection, the hotel was so clean with the best location too.  Miller and Carter we were served by “ED” he was so friendly and welcoming, the service was again faultless I cannot wait to rebook and stay again soon."
"Excellent from top to bottom! Location, well lit car park, beautiful hotel, rooms, wonderful shower, perfect temperature room, super comfy bed and lovely linen. Lovely reception and lounge areas and wonderful breakfast, sad we didnt stay longer to have a steak for dinner!... We will return again and again!!"
"Great hotel - thoroughly recommended! Centrally located, the rooms are specious, nicely decorated and contain everything you need for a few days’ stay. The reception area is smart and welcoming and the staff were friendly and helpful. Everything we could ask for and suited our relatively large party’s needs perfectly!"
"Excellent location in the centre by the cathedral and docks.   Superior room was fair - a little dated but a very comfortable bed and a Nespresso machine. Slept very well. Bathroom was fine but no bath and small shower. Mini bar was an empty fridge.   Staff on reception very pleasant and welcoming.   The breakfast feels very three star; not what I would expect of a higher end Marriott. Crowded buffet. Only filter coffee. Not a relaxing place.  They need to up their game on this.   Car park was full so I had to park by the docks. Lots of poorly parked cars taking up two spaces or 4 by 4s which can’t fit into the very narrow spaces; they need to look into this.   No lounge for higher elite Bonvoy holders. Not much recognition of status. “1,000 points”."
"Great location grand reception. Spacious junior suite room. Lovely view of cathedral and Wills building.  Room a bit tired. Bathroom definitely needs upgrade, very dated. Photo showed 2 sinks but only one. Breakfast good but only filter coffee available. Staff very helpful. Probably the best large hotel in Bristol in this area. Bristol needs more choice and competition to improve the standards."
"We were meeting up with friends weve not seen for sometime.  Stayed here, it was lovely the bar was nice for a few drinks, but then we booked at the steakhouse on Kings Street for a meal. Then cocktails in the bar opposite the hotel.  The room was lovely, considering we were in the centre of the city it was so quiet and the blackout curtains were great. No noise from the neighbours so good solid walls.  Decor was lovely, and air conditioning to. Lovely stay reasonably priced for Bristol."
"I guess we prefer smaller hotels so should have known what to expect here.  We found the public areas rather cold (literally and metaphorically) while our room on the 4th floor was airless and the bed was too hard for us. It overlooked the city; had I known, I would have asked for a river view. The breakfast was alright - a large buffet selection.  We enjoyed dinner at Miller and Carter - see separate review. Parking here is very easy and a big asset for the hotel.  Its  situation is perfect for sightseeing in Bristol.  But, it isn’t cheap!"
Booked a taxi and waited 15 minutes taxi turns up and drives off  Re booked another taxi and waited 40 minutes and still nothing  One receptionist really tried and other receptionist couldn’t be bothered  Top quality hotel £170 a room you expect better service for a hotel this size
"We decided last minute to stay the night in Bristol after a shopping day. We couldn’t have received a warmer welcome from Kim, she was so accommodating, kind and just such a credit to the hotel. Safe to say we shall be returning next time we are in Bristol. Lovely sized rooms, comfortable beds and the hotel decor is just beautiful. Thank you Kim and team!"
"At best a three star hotel.    The positives:  Comfortable bed Clean room Nice building from the outside City centre location  The negatives:  Inadequate staffing on reception- lengthy wait to check in  The breakfast service is very poor - being asked a room number on three occasions is excessive- but having to ask repeatedly for a hot drink is unacceptable  The hotel is dimly lit The room was not a four star one.   Poorly lit.  No minibar.   Bad lighting in the bathroom - hard to shave when one side of your face is, through the hotel’s design, in total darkness  On arrival I was told that the only room of the standard I booked was in the lower ground floor - yes - the basement.  That dingy room overlooked the staff smoking area - a table filled by an overflowing dirty ashtray"
Lovely welcome by Hannah. Fabulous location by the cathedral. This is a great hotel to choose when staying in Bristol. Very close to Old Town and to quayside as well. Beautiful interior. This certainly was one of our best Marriot stays.
"We have stayed at this hotel on many occasions and have always enjoyed the experience. It is perfectly located for local sightseeing activities and is close to many good bars and restaurants. The building is stylish and welcoming and the bedrooms are clean, comfortable and well equipped. The reception staff are consistently helpful, friendly and efficient, as are the bar and restaurant staff."
Stayed for 3 nights as a family of 3 - great room overlooking the street and didn’t have a problem with noise from the street.  Parking can be a bit tight - and finding the entrance initially across college green but reasonably priced through the hotel - don’t pay in the car park as I did to comply with the notices which don’t seem to mention hotel guests. Breakfast in Miller and Carter was good and well organised. Servicing of the rooms was first rate - all in all a great experience.  Do check your charges if you check out online - I was charged twice effectively but soon sorted out through email.
I stayed at this hotel several years ago and it had (still has) a fabulous swimming pool in the basement.  Sadly it's now been closed and drained.  Don't know if there's a leak or if they are just penny-pinching.  It seems the Marriott Bristol Royal is now in a race to the bottom.  I won't be staying again.
Always a warm welcome from the reception staff and bar tenders. The rooms are always perfectly clean and in great condition.  Breakfast as always is spot on. Perfect location to visit the bars and restaurants of Bristol. Would highly recommend.
"Love this hotel.  Right in the city centre with College Green to the front and the Cathedral to the left. Bristol is a buzzing city til the early hours, every single day, so many great restaurants and cafes. You're literally 2 minutes walk from the Hippodrome too, and, similarly the quayside. The second you walk into the hotel it's serene and beautiful. The staff are friendly and very helpful Have stayed 6 times now due to having a daughter doing 5 years at the Uni. Will no doubt go again before she graduates and possibly several more times if she gets her first job down there too Love the terrace looking at the cathedral, so peaceful, you'd not know you were in the heart of the city .  Great place for a beer or cocktail when the weather's good, although we sought the shady"
Stayed at the Marriott royal for a last minute ‘date night’. Requested additional foam and feather pillows and early check-in on arrival which we were provided with. The hotel is immaculate and stunningly presented (it even smells amazing). Room service is miller and carter and the service was speedy and food delicious. It’s an added bonus to have such a lovely restaurant just down stairs. Lovely areas to have a drink whether you want intimate or more bar lively atmosphere. Staff very welcoming and professional. They really took their time at check-in which made you feel important. Didn’t feel rushed and were helpful with recommendations of local eatery’s. The rooms are very spacious and the bed so comfortable. Large TV and tea and coffee making facilities. We traveled into the
This is a lovely hotel to stay in. Location is great. Staff are polite and helpful. Rooms are comfortable. Facilities and extras are good too. I have stayed at this hotel a few times now and planning to stay again in September.
"Beautiful but by far the worst I have ever stayed in.  On the journey home I realised I had left two dresses in the wardrobe. I was told the housekeeping dept. Would call me back. 24 hours later I receive a call to say there were no dresses. Except there was as I had left them there. She said she would call back the following day and never did. Neither dress was expensive but as I liked them it was quite annoying that they had clearly been taken by someone and assuming the rooms are cleared between guests it could only have been the housekeeping.    Two weeks later we also received a parking notice for £60, after we had paid the parking at reception upon check in.  Pick somewhere better & more trustworthy!"
"I had a really good stay here recently, lovely big room - really quiet and I had a great sleep which I rarely mange to get in hotels.  The hotel was in a perfect central location.  One nice little touch was that the bar / drinks area weren't that expensive at all - made a lovely change from most hotel prices!"
"There is no service in the hotel. Think of it like a Weatherspoons pub. Not that I've been in one for the last 17 years.  I booked 5 rooms for a family event and have never been spoken to with such contempt or attitude as I have at this place. I will be taking this higher up the food chain at Marriott.   Firstly, even before I arrived, two of the five rooms had randomly been cancelled for no apparent reason. We arrived with multiple bags as we'd been travelling for a month and was told that the doorman had gone home as it was past check-in time. I didn't see a doorman the whole entire visit.   We were then told that we couldn't access the balcony area as there was an event on. When I pointed out we also had an event on, I was told that the smokers in the group should smoke"
"We absolutely loved this hotel. The bedroom was very spacious, with a very comfy bed. Clean and well decorated. Lovely big bathroom with double shower. Staff and service was impeccable. Food excellent. Great location. Will definitely be visiting again."
"We recently stayed in the Royal Marriott Bristol. It was a comfortable night stay, bedroom clean and beds comfy. However we did have dinner there and the food was not great. Table service was poor. Overall customer service was only alright and not overly attentive. For the cost of a night stay I would expect a lot more."
"Stayed for one night recently and had a great experience overall.   This Marriott was clean, smart and fresh looking. Our room had some great art, smelt great and was just what we needed.   The usual Marriott bedding was comfy - they’re a fave of mine due to their comfy pillows (I’m a person who thinks pillows make or break a sleep).   The room service courtesy of Miller and Carter was the best room service I’ve had in the UK. The food was fresh, delicious and came fast. Would definitely recommend.   Would have liked fresh milk and would have been handy for the express checkout box to not be in the centre of the desk as it was almost impossible to access with the long queues but that’s a small complaint.   A great stay overall"
"I reviewed this hotel a couple of years ago and said I was disappointed with some of the changes made since we got married there …(eg pool has closed etc). However,  I have just stayed here again with a friend and I have to say it was an amazing stay. Air conditioned throughout and all so clean. The staff on reception were efficient and accommodating. We had a fab room overlooking the cathedral. Our room was so big and comfortable too and you just can’t beat the location for the nightlife on Park Street. We’ll def be back. My only negative comment is that so much more could be done with the ballroom - it could be used as a cafe or bar or restaurant or at the very least have it dressed for a wedding to show people how it can he used. It’s so stunning, seems such a waste to have"
"This hotel is beautiful, our room was big, clean and with a beautiful view! The staff are so helpful, nothing is too much trouble. Especially Sophie in Guest Services who I asked for help before our visit to arrange a special surprise for my partner on our anniversary. She was amazing, so helpful and thoughtful. The location is really good, there is a 24/7 fitness centre, room service and breakfast is really good too! Overall, we would definitely stay again and would highly recommend!"
"Excellent stay for a hen weekend.   Gorgeous hotel, lobby, tea room, bar etc. all beautiful and feel special.   Great to have the option for 2 doubles per room. Rooms and bathroom spacious, clean, bright, well decorated and provided with plenty of towels, flannels, toiletries, water, tea, coffee, and iron & ironing board. Comfortable beds (especially good pillows!)   Parking onsite a bonus and only £17 for a night if you pay in the hotel.  Didn't get to use the onsite gym but looked good. Didn't see the pool either.  Brilliant breakfast, plenty to choose from and all prepared well. Chef's happy to cook additions to the buffet, and all items were refilled whenever near empty.  The manager of the breakfast (blonde european woman) was particularly good and deserves a shout out. She"
"Lovely hotel situated right by the water front. Not too far from train station about £8 in a taxi.  We used this as a base for our hen do party. On arrival they had our rooms ready early which was perfect. Nice large clean rooms. Large shower with plenty of hot water. We had a room for four, they had only left two towels in the room but on speaking to reception within five minute two further towels arrived.  Would definitely revisit due to its location!  Many thanks"
"Well the room is clean and bed comfortable. The service at check is very distasteful, very rude, dismissive and arrogant reception manager. When querying a bill charge as previously the billed differently completely shut down. Not great customer service at all. Business booking, due to location will most likely stay again but not looking forward to it and will avoid eating in the hotel to avoid the receptionist on check out"
"Have stayed here twice.  Great location for the harbour / Park Street, short walk to Cabot Circus.  Parking on site (additional charge).  Modern and comfortable.  Breakfast wasn't great.  Hotel is clean and well maintained.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Would stay again."
"Really comfortable stay.  Huge shower instead of a bath.  Very quiet.  Great bar.  Excellent breakfast.  My only niggle is that at peak booking in time they need more than 2 staff on the reception desk. Parking is tight and at £17 quite expensive overnight, but essential as it is tricky to find otherwise."
"A beautiful and well-run hotel, well located in Bristol and only a 20 minute walk from Temple Meads station.  It’s a cut above a regular Marriott, having undergone a significant refurb only a few years ago. Staff are friendly, from check in to the fab breakfast."
"We have stayed here a few times over the years , the last time was when it was mid refurb several years age. We were in Bristol for the recent Elton John concert so wanted somewhere central where we could walk to Ashton Gate. Check in is normally 4 but I messaged ahead in the hope of an earlier one. We arrived about 2pm , managed to get a space in the underground car park, bargain for Bristol at £17. (You can use the Millennium Square car park for overnight but more expensive). Lovely greeting at reception , and, yes our room was ready. Situated on the 4th floor , it was quiet and clean. Good air conditioning not always essential but needed when we were there as it was hot. The bed was amazingly comfy , you don’t get free wifi unless you are a Bon Voyage member otherwise it’s"
"I stay regulalrly at the hotel for work and the love it. As soon as you walk in you feel like you're in a different world. The staff are so attentive and personable. There are so many that I don't the names of but Maria on the front desk and Patricia and Sonu in the breakfast restaurant are regular happy people! The rooms are spacious and kitted out nicely.  The only comment I would make is that a few of the front of house staff in the evening restaurant (two men in particular) can be a bit grumpy and therefore I don't eat there anymore. However, the service staff in the restaurant are always nice."
"Classy hotel with history in good central location at the foot of Park Street with dock area and university area easily accessible, Clifton a healthy walk away via Brandon Hill (or a short taxi ride). Miller and Carter on-site or many other restaurants within a short walking distance. Well stocked bar, popular but not crowded. Free ice-creams being handed out in the lobby as it was a hot day!"
Booked for a couple of nights on our way home from family wedding to celebrate a birthday. Not keen on our room and asked to change - front of house staff could not do enough to accommodate us and immediately changed our rooms which included an upgrade. They also checked later to make sure everything was ok.  All the staff we came across were friendly and professional. Dinner in the restaurant was really good too.
"A fabulously ideal location. Plenty of amazing restaurants and cafe’s for you. Warm, friendly and helpful staff. They offer delicious food in the hotel as well which is of course always a bonus. Beautifully designed rooms and amazing picturesque extras. Price wise - you get what you pay for. Would recommend to anyone of any age!!"
Although we only stayed for 1 night on May 1st we found this hotel to be beautifully clean.  We had 2 rooms which were spacious and well equipped.  The beds were very comfortable too.  All staff were friendly and extremely helpful.  The car park was great and the location of the hotel meant we didn't need to use the car during our stay.  We will certainly return.  Thank you  Rosemary and family
"Pre Covid, we have stayed at this hotel many times and always enjoyed the pool - which is now permanently closed, a very disappointing decision. The hotel still seems to think that covid rules (and excuses) still apply - they don't. Telling guests as they check in that the bar will shut at 10.45 but then being open when we returned at 12.15 is totally unprofessional. We made alternative (inferior arrangements) after our concert at Ashton Gate. I doubt we will return here again, when i am a guest in a hotel, i expect to be able 2 get a drink until a reasonable hour."
Very good place to stay. Front of house staff very welcoming and friendly. Very informative and nothing was a problem for them. The hotel is clean and well looked after.. If you are wondering where to stay in Bristol then look no further this is the hotel for you.
"The Bristol Marriott Royal was perfect for our recent annual business meeting - the hotel's central location, and smooth booking experience, made it an easy choice. Upon arrival, the front desk escorted our team to the conference room and then guided us through the amenities and screen connection.  The food and refreshment offering was excellent, the staff were attentive, and very helpful with dietary requirements.  I would strongly recommend the Bristol Marriott Royal to other businesses considering locations for future conferences or meetings of any size."
"A lovely hotel, with a lovely drive so you are not right on the road, and can get dropped off easily Bristol Cathedral is right next door, overlooking College Green, where we sat and enjoyed wine and nibbles from the nearby Tesco. I thought it was quite elegant. Friendly staff. We went to the bar before and after dinner out, good choice of cocktails and not rowdy at all. I would stay here again on my next Bristol visit."
Another lovely 2 night stay and we were well looked after by all the staff who were very helpful. Thanks very much! Our room looked out on the Cathedral and was in excellent condition and very comfortable. Car parking was simple and the hotel is central and in easy walking distance of most of the main areas/attractions so you can leave it there. Breakfast in the Miller and Carter Bar was varied and tasty. Will definitely stay again.
"What a fantastic hotel, great staff and lovely food, stayed an extra night too! Will definitely come back here! Close to all amenities, parked easily and I was in a van with my Lambretta scooter in the back, so nice and safe underground! Brilliant 😃"
"I stayed here over the April/May bank holiday weekend for my sister’s hen do, where we had a double room and an apartment. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I was pleased with my choice - the location is central and easy to get to, the car park is secure (some of the spaces are tight, but I have a small car, so it was fine for me), and the hotel itself feels grand and luxurious. The check-in process was easy, and I was incredibly impressed with the apartment - clean, modern, a full kitchen, and all other amenities available. The team were really helpful - from lending us a HDMI cable to providing me with ear plugs at 3am when one of my friends was snoring! I honestly have only good words to say about this hotel and my experience there, and I would strongly recommend to others."
"I recently held our team annual awayday at the Bristol Marriott Royal. Amrita and Ishta were both exceptional both in the lead up to the event and on the day, always on hand to answer any queries I had.   Parking was a breeze and the meeting room itself was well equipped with everything we needed throughout the day with the team contactable on the red coat app throughout the meeting.   Thank you Marriott team - we shall see you again!"
"If you are going to drive there, bring a small car- navigating your way round the car park, never mind finding a parking space, was painful. So many spaces were not fully available thanks to the car in the next pace (most are in pairs) creeping over.  Check-in was painfully slow. The room was a farce- so outdated that I thought I had woken up in 1973. Two of the three windows (all of which were pretty small) faced a wall that was within 6 feet- nice. Dank, dark, with a massive pillar right in the middle, insufficient sockets, no mini-bar and dreadful art. There was an old fridge (in which it would have been nice to have had a pint of milk left) and the bed and pillows were fabulous. Still, at least it wasn't £300 for the night- oh, hang on, it was!   The breakfast (buffet) was"
We stayed overnight and what can we say.  Hotel is well located and absolutely gorgeous.   Staff were fantastic.  There was a slight issue on check in caused by the booking agent not the hotel and they quickly rectified the problem. Food was excellent.  The facilities are also great.  All in all a fab stay.  We are returning again in July with our friend and can't wait.
Lovely hotel. Perfect location. Very central with  shopping and social scene close by. Very helpful and friendly staff throughout. Room was very clean and well equipped. Will definitely return soon.  Excellent  value for money too.  Very happy!
"I used to love coming to this hotel - it was smart, comfortable and so many helpful staff. Now there’s a few  shabby parts (peeling ceiling paint in the bathrooms), far fewer staff (all who are stressed and therefore not as available as they should/used to be) and even has a chain restaurant installed. But the worst thing - my room is 25C and getting warmer and they are doing nothing about it.  I’m here with my family and it’s a warm spell of weather and the air conditioning is not on. We have asked every half an hour to get it looked at but nothing. Most attempts to call front desk are left unanswered. Obviously I don’t know for sure, but my suspicion is that the staff are not allowed to turn on the air conditioning in April due to current very high electricity prices - they"
"We have stayed in the Marriott Royal for many years and enjoyed our stay. It is just over the road from the Hippodrome theatre which is perfect for us. If you want to be in a great place to sight see this is just right. Bristol Cathedral is steps away, the wharf is five minutes walk with its many restaurants - great for younger folk!  If you cross the water even more fabulous for young and old (can I say that 'old' word now?) several in containers,  do try Tere. Shopping is a short drive away if you have a car - which you can easily park in the Marriott Royal car park!  The hotel is nicely done, reception welcoming, rooms large with good bathrooms. Not a fabulous hotel   but certainly we will stay there again. The staff are really friendly and helpful, it's a pleasure to check"
"PROS:  1) Nice looking entrance & reception.  2) Large room. Very spacious. Relatively comfortable.   CONS:  1) No hot water. We tried for over 15 minutes.   2) No plug sockets by either side of the bed, meaning we couldn't charge our phones at night.  3) So so noisy. Constant loud noises from the floor above up until 12 at night, and then starting again at 5 in the morning.   4) What was described as a ""good view"" meant seeing 1 corner of the building next door through one window, and the other two windows facing brick walls.   Customer service was average. No smiles, but also no rudeness.  Wouldn't stay again."
"Stayed here with a friend for the night and we were really fortunate that our room was ready on arrival.  The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring Bristol.  The hotel was clean and tidy, the staff friendly.  It was no bother to change times for breakfast."
"Once again we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Bristol Royal. This is a terrific hotel located on College Green with indoor garage/carpark and easy walking to everything you want to see and do in Bristol. The hotel is a wonderful mix of old charm and modern decor, made so much better by the staff who really go out of their way to help you.  This is the only hotel for us and have stayed here numerous times.  We highly recommend it for a short city break."
"Stayed at the Bristol Royal for one night and had a lovely stay. Staff were great, our four poster suite was a good size, with separate living area, huge bathroom and of course a big four poster bed.  Dined at the on site Miller and Carter restaurant for dinner and breakfast and both food and service were excellent.  Overall a great stay and would be happy to return."
"Beautiful hotel and lovely room with very pleasant and friendly staff. They deserved 5 stars, however the breakfast was not up to the usual Marriott standard. Cheese was dry and turned up at the edges. Looked like it was a leftover from previous days. Smoked salmon was an off cut and turning brown; totally tasteless. Coffee was very poor quality. They wouldn’t serve cappuccino without an extra charge. Very unusual for a quality hotel. Fruit juice was poor quality and definitely made from concentrate. Omelette was good and staff very pleasant. I mentioned all of this to Hannah on reception who said she would report my comments to the management. I expect to receive compensation."
"Very disappointing. After arriving for one night, we decided to stay a second night. A catalogue of disasters followed. To start with our newspapers failed to arrive the following morning. We went out after a very mediocre breakfast to see The SS Great Britain ship (brilliant). Decided to go back to the hotel for a coffee in the bar, just to be told we had no (essential) credit at the bar, even though my husband had paid for it. We then went back to our room before going into the centre for some retail therapy, only to find we could not get into our room because reception had not extended our key -  frankly unbelievable. So I waited in the corridor whilst my husband - not best pleased of course - trapsed back to reception to sort it out. Not a hotel we would use again or"
"Our honeymoon visit is amazing ! 5 star treatment, especially from Kim on the front desk. Went above and beyond for us. So thankful for her smiley face and friendliness. The room is gorgeous and has everything you need. Overlooking the cathedral too. Super happy"
"Oozed class, lovely common areas, beautiful historic building with very comfortable rooms, reasonable prices (about 150 a night), right in the centre of Bristol, could walk everywhere. Nice bar area. Only small criticism is that check it took about 15 minutes and we were very tired on arrival. However, we were allowed to check in early."
"I booked this hotel for a midweek stay for my partner's 40th birthday, as I'd booked tickets to see a show at the Hippodrome.   The location was perfect. We had a lovely welcome and were delighted to receive an upgrade!  We had a fabulous suite on the top floor with a beautiful view, and it was a lovely surprise to receive little birthday gifts a card, and also a sweet teddy and activity pack for our daughter (a very thoughtful touch!). The room was excellent and very comfortable and really couldn't fault anything. There was a huge selection for breakfast and all of it was lovely!  Thank you Marriott Bristol for making a special occasion all the more special. We would certainly love to come again!"
Had one night in the Marriott Royal Hotel. The hotel is in a great location down by the river and handy for areas like Clifton. We had a large room on the third floor with nice views over an inlet to the river with some smart bars and restaurants. Overnight parking under the hotel for £17 was good value and very convenient. All that was great but the catering is provided by Miller & Carter and that was terrible. The breakfast was simply a bun fight - too many people accessing a buffet style breakfast that was constantly running out of choices and poor vegetarian selection. Food was poorly cooked and not very warm - overall the worst breakfast experience I have ever had. The 3 stars is for the hotel not the restaurant.
"My husband and I had a weekend in Bristol for his birthday. We had a fabulous room with fantastic views. Such a comfy bed and pillows. Great bathroom and furnishings. The hotel itself is beautiful, fantastic architecture and ambience. We had breakfast in the Miller and Carter restaurant which was good. Staff were polite, smart and professional"
"Excellent hotel with character, well located on College Green.  Very friendly and efficient service, clean and well kept throughout. Visiting family in Bristol we have stayed in a few hotels in the vicinity, and this is the best by a country mile. Thank you very much, we shall be back."
"We have stayed in this hotel many times before. Its location is perfect and there is a very good car park. It is necessary to be very careful when entering the car park as access requires crossing a cycle lane and pedestrianised area.  Sadly the hotel swimming pool is now closed, this appears to be increasingly common in many of Marriotts hotels.  We were pleased with the room and glad to see that there was both a bath and shower in the bathroom. The restaurant and bar in the hotel are now operated by Miller and Carter. Some historic features of this hotel like the Palm Court are now very underutilised."
I stayed at this hotel whilst on a business trip in March 2022. The hotel is centrally located and literally next door to Bristol Cathedral. There are a number of shops and and ATM’s close by.  I was welcomed with some cupcakes at reception and was pleasantly surprised by a perfumed aroma which adorned the hotel. In the evening I was able to head for drinks with friends at the bar downstairs And had a good hearty breakfast in the morning at the Miller and Carter restaurant.  Looking forward to staying there again on my next visit.
"The place is at best location but the rooms need refreshment, soon renovation. There are so many empty common areas on ground floor that are not really used, it would make the difference as meeting point in the city if used efficiently. Sitting in the lobby area there is no service as to have a coffee or tea despite that the place is truly nice. You could sit all day and noone will ask if anything is needed. If you want to have a coffee you need to trace it at the bar which is on the other side of the lobby. The rooms will need renovation soon to replace the old carpets etc. its the right place to stay in bristol mainly because of location and that there are not many hotels around and no 5* place to stay close to city center. But could be much better if attention was paid on the"
Rooms are quite nice and spacious - the view was not the best but I didn't take the most expensive room.  Good location and the service is good overall - housekeeping does a good job too.  I think it's quite good value for money considering that the breakfast was also included in my options.
"We had booked this hotel for a two night weekend stay, upon arrival we headed to the underground car park, this is very tight and the spaces are very small. As a disabled badge holder I found the disabled spaces small and most had no cars without disabled badges parked in them.   We arrived at check in and this was very quick and the lady was very friendly. We paid for parking and for breakfast for both mornings, this was quite expensive.  We had booked an upgraded room and this was very nice, a little dated but still a nice size and the bathroom was lovely.  The bed was very firm and the pillows were very thin and uncomfortable, we both woke up with stiff necks, as did our friends who were also staying. The quilt was very think and again quite old with bunches up patches. This"
"This is a lovely hotel in a prime position for the many attractions that Bristol has to offer. Parking on site is easy (although beware of the bus lanes and one way systems in reaching it!). Staff on the front desk were friendly, cheerful and efficient and our superior room on the third floor was very comfortable and well equipped (no bath but a spacious and efficient shower), cosy bath robes and a reasonable array of toiletries.  Breakfast served in the Miller and Carter restaurant on site was reasonable value at £16 per head with a good range of cooked items plus pastries and a limited cold selection. The addition of fish however would have been welcome.  My only slight criticism of the hotel concerns the decor in some of the reception rooms and upstairs corridors. Whilst the"
"Had a brilliant Saturday night at the Bristol Royal, staying in the Royal suite. Fantastic service, wonderful location in this vibrant city. Easy to access, simple to park, super dinner and great breakfast. We will definitely be back, thank you!"
"The hotel building is lovely.   We paid a fair price for location and quality of room.  Our suite had thick cotton robes, a comfort on chilly days.   The suite appeared recently renovated; however, the chairs arranged at the table were very worn/torn and there was also a little glass container of very dusty old potpourri on the toilet, strange that a room that looked fresh and clean would have these items, a sad contrast.  The bedroom was quiet which we appreciated after long days out.  Be cautioned of the 4 poster bed, if you are used to a soft side mattress.  The front desk staff, that we encountered, all came across as new and inexperienced.  Breakfast: Breakfast was on the low end for a Marriott property. The bread/muffins were cheap grocery store quality.  There were no"
"A memorable hotel for its luxurious classic furnishings/architecture and spacious, modern- styled  bed and bath rooms. Great location, good views over the  city even from first floor room. The staff were helpful and polite, though overworked spread too thinly at check-in time (a surprisingly late 4pm) - perhaps this was an off day related to storm Eunice disruption, so might be fine another day. They fixed a problem with something I left in my room and posted it back! Great service."
"Staff were extremely friendly and informative, they really made us feel special and welcome. We were given a room with the view of the Cathedral which made the trip even more spectacular! Ask for a room on the top 4th floor for great views of the surrounding area and the cathedral.  The bedrooms were modern and felt fresh and clean. Room service was a little pricey and not many vegetarian or vegan options, but overall the food was delicious.  Plenty of choice for breakfast also after the in house Miller and Carter restaurant. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again! It felt really magical."
"Beautiful hotel, well equipped rooms which were lovely and clean plus very helpful staff and amazing breakfast … what more could you ask for!  Bristol Harbourside is full of fantastic bars and places to eat and close enough to walk to Cabot circus to shop."
"It was great to re-visit this hotel after the worst of the pandemic had passed.  I was welcomed with great warmth by the Reception staff even though I had arrived very late in the evening. I felt Covid-safe and even though the staff were in face masks (which I really appreciated) I could see the smile in their eyes. This made a real difference after a long journey.  I attended a conference which was being held in the hotel. The spaces were fantastic and the catering even better than I remember. As a first foray into face to face conferences, this was a great experience.  Dinner was held in the 'garden room' area at the Centre of the hotel which offers a wonderful space.  The bedroom was well appointed and comfortable. It was spotlessly clean and I really appreciated the"
"Stayed for 2 nights and chose as location for getting around and restaurants high was good. As we drove 2 hrs also chose because they have parking below.  Easy to park, plenty of spaces but is £17 per 24hrs  Hotel is big, rooms were ver clean and cleaned well each day. Beds comfy, pillows too soft for my liking but that’s always personal.  Tbh had sky sports in room which was an added bonus for once we’d got back from a days walking! As was a fridge so we could put our own drinks in.  Only downside, as a family room, I had read you had a view of the green or college- well, we had a huge brick wall outside our room - the side of a building I believe— if you craned your neck and looked as far to the left as you could, you could make a tiny view/gap Out of the area at the front of"
"We just had an amazing two nights stay.  Brilliant location, amazing staff, spacious room and cleanliness up to the standard.  The gym was nice and clean as well. We are more than happy. Definitely we will come again! Thank you!"
"Firstly the hotel is situated in a perfect location to access all areas very easily, lots of places to eat, have coffee locally. Reception staff were very welcoming, nice entrance and family room comfortable with a good amount of space. Beds comfortable, shower good. Housekeeping good.   Breakfast was fine; I travel a lot for business and it is a fairly standard offering, buffet hot items, DIY toast, cereal in containers to help yourself. I was a little underwhelmed to be honest. I did ask the waitress for an Americano and was told I would have to pay extra for that!   I would give 3.5 stars if I could, but opted for 4 as feeling generous… one of the main reasons for this is the terrible sound proofing between the rooms. I could hear a full conversation the other the side and it"
"A beautiful hotel, the bar and seating areas - comfortable and luxurious! The staff are accommodating and friendly.  Breakfast is plentiful and fresh, however no omelettes at the weekend is ridiculous and disappointing.  The room as huge and i really liked the layout, plenty of light and a great mirror for makeup, bed was huge and very comfortable. Super location too, can walk every where its so central."
"Upon c/in the breakfast wasn't explained also not offered, creating some confusion the next morning in the breakfast room. I've asked the receptionist that I would like to pay for an upgrade, this was been ignored and I was given a room on 4th floor small and dark. After a room changes the 2nd room was slightly better but very bad on soundproof, I could hear the guest in the next room. After taking a bath there are no slippers any bathrobes, not a single bottle opener, my partner called reception requesting one, the receptionist mentioned that couldn't deliver since she was alone, to our surprise when we get to reception two receptionists were chatting with each other and putting makeup!!! A very poor experience, lack of training, I won't be returning"
"What a fabulous hotel. The building itself is gorgeous and beautifully decorated and you couldn’t get a more central location. The room was well sized with two incredibly comfortable queen sized beds with lovely linens and a pillow menu. All the facilities you could ask for, safe, hairdryer, iron, kettle, Nespresso machine, robes, slippers good sized TV (no foreign channels though) were in the room which was very clean. The staff was lovely and there is a car park under the hotel.  If driving from the south be careful of some of the roads coming over the waterways as they have bus gates which can catch you out if you are not careful. "
Excellent hospitality - staff are extremely accommodating. Lovely decor and feels like taking a trip abroad in the heart of Bristol. Wouldn’t hesitate to visit again. Great vibe and  wonderful tea room. Special thank you to the gentleman in a suit with glasses on Monday evening/Tuesday morning.
I stayed at this hotel a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed my stay so had no hesitation in rebooking for this stay. Unfortunately my experience this second time was very different. Firstly I waited 20 minutes to be checked in. This was due to the fact that only 2 receptionists were available at arguably the busiest time of the day. After that delay I was in a rush to drop off my luggage and meet my friend for dinner so paid little notice to the condition and cleanliness of the room. I returned late and again did not notice anything amiss as it was so late and I was very tired. The next day I was surprised to see that the sink in my bathroom was filthy - see pictures. It looked as though it had been cleaned inside but not underneath. I was quite shocked by this as I have
"Fantastic conference and stay. A very enjoyable evening and service was second to none.   Would recommend the Marriott anytime.   Good location, venue and food.  Georgie was a fantastic waitress and went the extra mile, will definitely book this venue again!"
"Beautiful hotel situated very well in Bristol with parking within the hotel. Staff are very friendly. Hotel room was beautiful. Very comfortable bed, very nice bathroom. We would definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone. 5 * in every sense."
"we stayed two nights but went for room only as there are plenty of options to eat out in the centre of Bristol. Great location and friendly staff, v comfortable beds. We also had a nice upgrade -thanks."
Stayed 2 nts in October for my partners birthday-hotel was fantastic. Super close to the Hippodrome & for Clifton. Staff in the hotel couldn't do enough to help…before and during our visit. Nothing was to much trouble-faultless customer service. Have stayed here 4 times previously & it never disappoints!  Thank you Bristol Royal Marriott for a fab weekend-see you again soon!
"We were staying at the Marriott Bristol Royal for 2 nights while visiting friends and celebrating 2 birthdays.  From the first greeting at check-in to leaving was excellent, nothing was too much trouble.  Hospitality establishments are often let down by poor service or rude untrained staff. The bar staff were fast and efficient as was the lunch time room service which we used in our royal suite for drinks when our friends arrived to stay on the second day. We had one small issue which was dealt with immediately by the duty manageress.  The breakfast was good and plentiful.   I would not hesitate in staying again"
"Amazing hotel great staff , miller & Carter is amazing , staff are great very friendly, peroni lovely and cold  Can’t wait to go back , best hotel I’ve stayed in in bristol Rooms are lovely and clean very comfortable, very warm. Great location just up from the Hippodrome, lovely bars and restaurants on the river"
"I have been staying in this building as a hotel for over 15 years and in the past it has been great. However, these days  just don’t expect to be able to eat if you arrive later that 9pm.   The bar food finishes at 1900 the restaurant at 2045 and room service at 2245.  We were not made aware of any of this  of this, despite asking for food from when we arrived at 2045. So we had drinks in the bar, very nice staff etc, but gone to bed with no food.   Quite despicable for a hotel of the this class and cost.   I will not be returning."
"Glamorous hotel in a perfect central position next to the Bristol cathedral, town and restaurants. Lovely staff who go the extra mile to make your stay special. Car parking under the hotel which made life easier. Sylvie on reception went out of her way to help and a lovely warm welcome. I was struggling with my leg, and Tabitha the breakfast waitress offered to give me table service which was very thoughtful. Highly recommend. Tip ask for the WiFi code to enable seamless connection."
"When booking this hotel, it seemed quite pricey but we it was an ideal location for a wedding we were attending so we bit the bullet and booked!  I am so glad that we did, what a lovely hotel.    From the moment we arrived to the moment we let, the stay was impeccable.  We stayed in a room on the same floor as reception so we were concerned that it would be noisy but it was so quiet.  The room was comfortable, quiet and had everything that you would want it to have.   There is a very large car park underneath the hotel which always had a space available and it was secured at night (although do remember to get the entry code if you go out at night!!).  Location-wise, you are just a short walk from the town centre and nightlife so it was perfect.  The communal areas were so clean,"
"Stayed at this hotel for a short one night stay, we were welcomed by Sylvia at check in, so helpful, polite and cheerful, we had requested an early checkin as we needed to drive on  to Cardiff to watch the rugby as check in is quite late ( 4pm) we received a text at 10:30 am letting us know our room was ready, which was a great help to us. Our room was spacious and very clean, we overlooked the beautiful art gallery room, the hotel was busy however our room was so quiet and we had a peaceful nights sleep. The hotel is situated next to the river and many restaurants /bars along the river where you can grab breakfast at a much cheaper cost then the £15.00 per person the hotel charges. We did visit the hotel bar and they had a good selection of gins, the service was good and it was"
"My wife and I have been loyal supporters of the Marriott Brand for many years, having been guests at their hotels across Europe, & North America.  On this occasion we had a short week end stay, in celebration of our anniversary.  We were checked in at the front desk by the delightfully professional Ellie, who could not have been more helpful in answering our numerous requests, concerning travel, and places to visit, and her advice ensured that we made the most of our short time there.  The imposing hotel is in a perfect location to act as a starting point for travelling around Bristol, and is also centrally located.  The building is grand in appearance, but our short stay, on this occasion, did not enable us to explore it more fully.  Our sumptuous room had a large stylish TV,"
"4 “older” friends booked 2 family rooms with an interconnecting door to enjoy a night in Bristol.  This means bathrooms with either a shower or a bath.  From our initial enquiry through to check out every colleague there was polite, courteous and friendly - even though we were late for our breakfast booking.   The rooms were spotless and well maintained.   Breakfast was delicious and plentiful.  Great location for our stay and in walking distance of bars such as The Florist and Gin & Juice. As well the restaurants and bars in Baldwin Street and Corn Street - particularly Sam Carlo’s!  Would definitely stay at this hotel again."
"First, the positive things. The location is great, the building is beautiful, and some of the staff was wonderful.   Secondly, the negative things. When we checked in, they told us that they won’t clean the room unless we asked for it. Considering what we payed for the room, that was a bit off. One thing is to not change the sheets and towels every day, but to not clean at all? Despite us asking them to clean (one day we had to ask four times), they were slow and did not provide us with enough toilet paper.   The internet was also horrible. We were told that the internet was included, but what was included was an internet speed of 1,5-2,1 Mbit/s. Normal internet speed is usually around 20 Mbit/s. We couldn’t work with that internet speed, missed online meetings and could barely"
"We stayed in a top floor 'suite', this comprised a larger room with sofa area, and a further bedroom. It was actually two bedrooms with private connecting corridor was used as two rooms when the suite wasnt booked. Rooms were serviced every three days as standard. This meant that when our room wasn't serviced in the morning we had to call to enquire why - seemed strange given the cost of the room. The decor and furnishing was adequate, but not particularly special. The image of the lounge area use in the marketing photos was actually a side room off reception, which in itself was uninspiring. The total cost for Sat & Sun was £840 - items like car parking (£17/day/tight spaces!), breakfast (£15/pp) were not included in the rate. One morning we walked to Browns Restaurant for"
Stayed here a few times now for work/training. Its a great hotel. Such good character. Staff very friendly and very helpful with everything. Shame the pool closed due to covid. However the gym is cool. Small but it works. Not that busy either which is good. Perfectly situated with loads within a short walk. Will be staying again.. Whenever i come to Bristol
"Utterly mediocre experience. Booked a suite as a special treat for a weekend away. On the plus side the parking was convenient and the room made available for an early check in, but it went downhill from there.  Living area of the suite reeked of cigars. Floor hadn’t been vacuumed and one of the bins hadn’t been emptied.   Whilst housekeeping remedied the latter two points, nothing was done to try and mask the foul smell, putting the living room out of use for us and leaving me wondering what I paid for.  Room poorly stocked for 2 guests - one dressing gown, one packet of biscuits, miserly offering with toiletries.  By 7pm there was no hot water available either and around 10pm that evening I ventured down to the bar to get a drink to take back to the room. Wow. Not really the"
"Booked on Booking and asked two questions for our family of 5 for the Week end break in Bristol: (a) do you have to book a car park place (b) can we have connecting room. Very pleased to have been answered in 2 minutes that we don t need to book the car park place as the adjoining public parking is large enough. Very nice receptionist who advised us on the museum etc. friendly, fast and energetic. There comes the problem: DO YOU WANT TO HAVE BREAKFAST ? As a family with 4 kids, the Breakfast is always a treat on the Sunday morning. In this case we are told that it s actually full, and we could only come at 8am... I mean who operates such a system? why not tell me when I asked the questions 2 weeks before re parking etc. The hotel seems to have been recently refurbished. it s"
"So I took my sister to the marriott royal for her 40th birthday to celebrate in a lovely 5 star room. When we arrived they were filming inside. ( Was not told this or emailed regarding this) we couldn't see reception as the film crew were everywhere. We were taken to another room & didnt see how to check in or do anything!! After 3 minites a lady came to get our bags. She was sweet and we thanked her. Then we were told to basically "" Be quiet & shut up""!! I couldn't believe this welcome we got as guests on my sisters 40th birthday! I was so mad at this welcome. We went out and tried to enjoy are day. When we returned I spoke to Kim the manager who was very helpful and sweet. She let us have the parking off and upgraded us to a suite for no extra cost. She was fantastic and"
"We actually stayed in August 2020 (have been a little tardy in writing a review). Warm and efficient welcome at reception was followed by a little bit of a trek to our room.  The room was okay - tidy, space was okay, generally a little tired.  the bed was comfy though. Nicely located hotel for getting out an about in Bristol. breakfast was in the in-house steakhouse, food was okay, but service was amateurish and generally not a great experience. All in all a pretty good stay, particularly good location and the grand reception rooms were special."
Amazing experience with a top hotel where the staff were very polite and helpful and the room was good quality and clean with an excellent bed. Check in and check out was simple with no issues or delays. The on site Miller and Carter restaurant was fabulous with great food and again good service.
"This used to be a good hotel, sadly it’s now trading on former glories. Poor service, laborious check in systems, understaffed and those staff there are trying to enforce weird hotel systems  on unwilling guests (eg you can’t just turn up for breakfast, you have to prebook). Oh, and the room smells odd.   Don’t bother."
"The hotel was gorgeous and rooms were well appointed and comfortable like you would expect from a full service Marriott. Sophie at the front desk was absolutely wonderful and so helpful when we checked in.   The hotel is also very baby friendly and had the travel cot and even a diaper pail set up in our room before we checked in. They do not have a proper mini fridge but were kind enough to ""check"" my frozen milk into their freezer to store for me during our stay."
"Stayed here twice and it was so hot it was unbearable. Awful inface. When we told staff they did not seem bothered.We have stayed here on a number of occasions as the hotel it's self was very nice. Although now the rooms do need money spending on them as the price is not reflected on the hotel right now. Also breakfast was awful.bad quilty bacon and sausages,the egg was awful,beans standard left out to long beans. Need I say anymore. The guy at the reception that seemed to be high up and told the waitresses what to do,Was unprofessional and put me off my food to be honest.Anyway we will not return to this hotel ever again.nevwr had an appolagy off anyone or offered anything as a offering to say come here again. Waste of money. Better places now in Bristol to stay at. "
"My wife and I have just returned from a short stay at The Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel.  The Hotel is absolutely wonderful. The Staff and Service were first class they were   very friendly, polite and helpful. The Hotel is in a perfect setting for you to explore this   City."
"I have stayed for few days earlier this month. The location is very convenient and the rooms are spacious, but need some renovation. Not enough plugs for ipad/cell/laptop as it is obviously an old structure building. One of the two lifts was broken and out of order for days and there was delay sometimes. To have breakfast you need to make a reservation in case breakfast is not in ones package. This is something i experienced first time in my life and i am a regular traveller around many places. Not correct in my view, as residents should have been reserved enough places even if they decide to have breakfast last moment. In general it was ok. Some renovation would make it a really good place to stay. The common areas are fine. The staff is friendly and the place is clean no doubt."
"The hotel needs an urgent renovation, old, old old, beds smalls comparing with other hotels within this category. 2 days with our room without service, we arrive from excursions and the bed and the room was not made. At the bar, no service to the tables available. Good parking and good location. The photos at any web are not according to reality."
"My favourite hotel in Bristol, the perfect location for a night out…walking distance to all the best bars, clubs and restaurants. Classy, clean and modern with friendly, attentive staff. Beautiful rooms, restaurant and foyer. The only hotel I’ll stay at in Bristol."
"We arranged to see a show at the Bristol Hippodrome and then set about searching for the perfect night stay at a hotel within close walking distance to the theatre and nearby restaurants. And we were not left disappointed! In fact, having stayed at a number of hotels in the past, I can honestly say that this is best hotel in Bristol that we have stayed in!  The hotel is superb, ultra-clean and the food is excellent.  However, what made it for us is the staff - they are the jewel in the crown!"
We enjoyed our stay - location is fantastic very close to the bars and restaurants on the waterside.- Underground secure car park with plenty of spaces - Nice room with friendly staff . 10 min walk to the city centre and to SS Great Briton The hotel us very grand
"We stayed here for three nights this last week and have been so impressed by this hotel. Our Superior Royal room was so spacious, clean and comfortable. The whole hotel has a very grand feeling to it. The staff were very friendly - we found a bottle of wine, shortbread biscuits and card in our room wishing us a happy anniversary which was a lovely touch. On our way out one morning we bumped into the lady servicing our room and she gave us water bottles as it was so hot outside.  The fitness centre is great with lots of machines and weights. Breakfast was buffet style and plenty of choice. Location is great for walking around Bristol."
Came here for the night to experience this hotel and was not disappointed had the wow factor from the moment we walked in all staff are friendly and professional and nothing is to much trouble for them we unfortunately had a issue with our tv in the room and the lady who came to try to fix it was so friendly and moved us quickly into another room. The room was just amazing and so beautiful I cannot thank the staff enough for making our stay amazing
"Perfect location for catching a show in the theatre. All the staff are really friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and there was hand sanitisers all over the lobbies and hallways. All the staff wore masks, would have liked to see more guests wearing them! Very comfy beds and great sized rooms. The parking feels very secured and £17 is a great price for Bristol city centre. Breakfast was delicious with lots of choice. Would recommend and would definitely return. It’s worth the price."
"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night over the bank holiday weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel is fabulously located in the centre of Bristol close to shops and restaurants etc. We drove into the carpark early at 10:15am and located a space straight away. The carpark is tight but there are lots of big 4x4 cars in here so you can still park comfortably you may take up 2 spaces that’s all. £17 for 24 hours.  We headed for reception to be surprised to find our room was ready. We were handed an anniversary card and small box of short bread biscuits in celebration of our anniversary. The staff all had masks on and are very friendly, helpful and welcoming. The hotel is very tastefully decorated and immaculately clean. The superior room we had was overlooking"
"We have stayed in many hotels in Bristol over the years and none have matched this one! All the staff are second to none,you could not ask for better customer service from any of the staff members you come into contact with! The rooms are beautifully clean and the food is great,nothing is too much trouble! The children especially did not want to leave! Also a brilliant base for exploring Bristol! We cannot wait to return! Thank you!"
We stayed here on a Friday evening to attend an event nearby. The car park underneath the hotel is very tight and split across multiple levels. There's also no electric vehicle charging which is disappointing considering the overnight rate is £17 for hotel guests.  The hotel was clean and staff very friendly although directly outside the hotel seems to be a gathering place for younger people drinking on the street/green area.  There was a fire alarm set off very early in the morning by somebody drinking who came in to the hotel. Obviously not the hotel's fault directly but there wasn't much organisation from the staff on duty once we were all outside waiting with no update.
Great hotel in a fab location.  The hotel was lovely and clean with helpful reception staff and right next door to the car park.  Our room was spotlessly clean with a great size telly. Tea and coffee facilities were available but no spoons which was unusual but improvised with a coffee sachet as a spoon. This hotel is in a great location for the shops and harbouring. Fantastic breakfast in the morning.  
"A good hotel with everything we needed. Location was brilliant and right by the harbor and cathedral. Toiletries and coffee/tea provided were of a good standard, including nespresso coffee machine and pods. Hotel was clean and staff were friendly and attentive. We had breakfast at Miller & Carter one morning for 15GBP and found it to be good value compared to other local eateries considering the range of food and drinks offered."
Spent one night at the Bristol Royal. The room was lovely and recently refurbished I think. It was also a good sized room. It’s a lovely building. Very grand. Communal spaces were really clean. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Breakfast was standard but not great selections.
"I stayed here for a friends wedding, was extremely impressed, stunning looking building with lovely rooms, staff and restaurant, everything about it was great, was also ideally located, highly recommend."
This has been a dream of mine to stay here in this wonderful city & it did not disappoint.  It was grand & sophisticated.  It was full of history & amazing architecture  The service was impeccable & the rooms were large & extremely comfortable.  I love Bristol & have stayed many times.  But not in at the Royal. It was my first stay but certainly will not be the last
The area is great and the hotel very attractive and spacious . Staff marvelous. Great food and drink. We were upgraded to a wonderful room with a walk in shower and the room was lovely .beds really great. We loved the hotel and it was a totally good experience All staff were wonderful. We liked the bar and restaurant a lot.It was a terrific stay many thanks. The entire stay was perfect.  We really were so happy here and found it great value. I stay in lots of hotels or used to and this was perfect for us.
"After 2 postponements, my daughter and son-in-law were married at the Marriott Royal Hotel. The whole day was perfect; beautifully organised with not one detail missed. All staff at the hotel were helpful, professional and engaging and made our weekend such a pleasant experience. The Palm Court and Kings suite were such beautiful spaces for the ceremony and reception. Thank you to everyone for making it such a memorable occasion."
"There are cheaper hotels in Bristol, and we are normally tempted by the reliability of a Premier Inn, however the Bristol Marriott Royal is a favourite of ours. Parking on-site is a convenience we're happy to pay for, and the location is fabulous, with the harbourside, good restaurants, museums and attractions right on your doorstep. We visited Bristol Cathedral (free) next door, the M Shed, and We The Curious + the Planetarium. The atmosphere in this part of the city is great, with salsa classes going on in Millenium Square and Capoeira martial arts in the nearby Lloyds ampitheatre. Hospitality is stretched at present with the pingdemic so I would recommend booking restaurants several days in advance as everywhere is very booked up. The hotel is lovely, with stunning public"
"Had a two night stay and was extremely pleased with the experience. Beautiful building for such a large hotel, absolutely full of character and felt rather grand. Receptionists were extremely professional and attentive. Room was spotless.  The location was perfect for a short stay with plenty of independent places for lunch/dinner and the hotel parking was reasonably priced and no need to drive at all over a 3 day stay.  In walking distance of places such as Clifton which was a gem.  Would not hesitate to return. We stayed Sunday & Monday which was almost half the price of a weekend. Would definitely return."
Had a lovely weekend break.  Arrived earlier than check in time and enquired what time our room would be ready.  Receptionist said she would check and informed us our room was ready straightaway.   Room was large with everything you needed for a short break.  Bathroom and shower were a good size.  All the staff we encountered during our stay were polite and welcoming.  Car park good value at £17 for 24 hours. Would definitely stay again and recommend Only issue was the noise outside in  the street on Saturday night but not the fault of the hotel (was the first weekend of freedom! and we did have the window open)   Sunday night was quiet
"We moved to this hotel at the last minute from another location and I’m glad we did.  While our room on the first night was gloomy without a ground level window, we were moved on the second night to a lovely room with a view of the cathedral.  Thank you to Sylvie who was so gracious in finding us a new room! This is a classic hotel that has been nicely upgraded and everything seemed clean and well-maintained. Staff were professional and the only downside is that the location (right downtown) was crazy at night with lots of drunk people on the streets, making it hard to arrive or leave the hotel or get into the parking lot. That is not the hotel’s fault at all, but it did impact our stay."
Have stayed here quite a few times now. Right in the city centre but with a good secure car park underneath which costs 17 pounds for a 24 hour period. Whilst this is on top of your room rate most Bristol hotels don’t have any parking and you have to walk to NCPs etc so this also encourages us to go back to the The Royal over other hotels. Hotel has had some recent refurbishment and our room was very nice. We didn’t eat in the hotel and went out to a local restaurant for breakfast so can’t comment on the food which seems to have recently become a Miller and Carter Restaurant.
This hotel was absolutely fabulous. The staff were amazing and the room was clean and was furnished with everything we needed. The buffet breakfast also delivered a lovely continental and traditional breakfast selection. A great example of a good Marriott hotel in a really convenient location and it really was the cherry on top to our lovely stay in Bristol.
"Camera here for the second time in last year, this time during war and sunny month of June not November lol. Anyway check in was smooth and room was waiting for us. Rooms are typical marriott style which we love. Clean and spacious. We booked the table in the miller and carter both nights and meal was lovely! Due to covid we didn't wait long for the food to arrive as there wasn't that many ppl but even if u have to wait its still awesome! I suggest get those steaks! Highly recommended 👌.  We will be back again for sure"
"My partner and I stayed 4 nights in late June 2021. There were problems in various areas.  We tried to pre-book dinner by ringing the hotel the day before.  The person I spoke to said I had to ring Reception and could not transfer me.  He sent Reception an e mail. It was impossible to get a dinner time on our first night as residents between 5.15 pm and 10.30 pm.  Food and bar are run separately by Miller & Carter.  Breakfast on the Sunday morning had to be pre-booked and was only available on our check-in before 7.15am and after 10.00 am.  We opted for Room service, at  cost of £ 4 extra pp.  Think poor airline food, plastic containers, no side plates etc.  Breakfast on our other mornings in the restaurant  was OK, though butter (Lurpak in small containers)  was liquid, not"
"Just wanted to leave a note to say that the reception staff were absolutely exceptional during our stay. They couldn't do enough for us, and from lost key (oops...) to extending our checkout time, nothing was too much trouble. It really made a difference. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel, even though we miss the swimming pool! Not the first time we've stayed and I'm sure it won't be the last."
"My wife and I stayed at the Marriot over the weekend and must express how much we enjoyed the hotel and facilities. Unfortunately, the swimming pool was not open but the gym is of a good size with plenty of machines.  The location of the hotel is superb, it's right in the centre of town where it's all happening. The hotel houses a restaurant called Miller and Carter, Michelin rated and reasonably priced.  The hotel staff were very accommodating especially when I managed to jam the hotel room door with the security latch. Well worth the stay and totally recommend it to anyone."
"Simply, to say, thank you to my new found Hungarian and  Polish friends, and all the kind and helpful staff at the hotel. A special thanks to Bence who was so effusively professional and amicable in his hospitality, for which I am grateful.  Köszönöm szépen, Egészségedre, es Viszontlátásra."
"My wife and I stayed there in June of this year for a few nights in a superior room on a high floor.  Our room was spotlessly clean and a good size although the view down to the harbour was spoilt by the dirty windows. Check in was quick and even though we had turned up early our room was available for us, staff were courteous friendly and professional throughout the hotel. Car parking is safe, giving easy access to the hotel via internal staircase or lift.  Didn't have the breakfast , but we had a very nice evening meal in Miller and Carter, and some drinks in the lounge near the entrance.  We enjoyed it that much in June, I'm about to book another 4 nights there for next week."
The hotel was lovely. Along with the staff who recommended us some great places to visit.  AWFUL that it says free parking are expected to pay £17 a night. Needs to be a lot more clear ! Shocking wouldn’t recommend to someone with car
"Stayed here last week with family as a 2 night break, we are I admit not easily impressed however I have got to say we had a great stay at the royal Marriott in Bristol. The stay were excellent and went out of their way to ensure we were happy and comfortable especially Mandy on reception. The breakfasts were great with plenty of choice to satisfy all of our differing tastes and plenty of it. We are planning our next trip to Bristol and will definitely stay here again."
Lovely hotel very clean we had great service from the staff at reception and bar. The car park was very secure so well worth the payment. The hotel is located perfectly for getting around close to the hub of Bristol and all it has to offer. The only one thing on the downside was that the cleaning lady knocked on our door at 9.30 to try and get access to our room so she could start the change over. Check out is not until 12 so this was a bit naughty but this did not take away from our wonderful stay in this hotel and we will most certainly return
"Great building and communal areas, average room, dire breakfast. Check in staff fabulous. TV worked intermittently. Breakfast was disappointing, dirt cheap ingredients poorly prepared. Juice from concentrate, toast by Sunblest (pap ), grapefruit from a tin, cooked breakfast overcooked and underwhelming.  Add £2 to the bill and use fresh ingredients for goodness sake. Coffee was nice….."
"Would say: 1. best location and generally nice look about the place 2. great room size for price (superior king) 3. Despite recent renovation a few niggles here and there (uneven shower floor, hot water took time to heat up, a few stains here and there) 4. food at breakfast place (miller carter) was pretty poor. Bog standard but expect better from a hotel venue. Great options nearby 5. Given close to harbourside, sometimes get a bit of noise from the crowds on a fri/sat night if room on that side (clubs were closed) 6. check-in was seamless and easy for ubers if needed 7. TVs a bit of pain given 1. you had to log in yourself, wi-fi not strong enough and no links to prime/netflix etc [not possible to link to your phone]"
"Great hotel but seriously let down by the bar and restaurant run by Miller and Carter. Breakfast just terrible, cold poor quality, uncaring untrained staff. Lunch and dinner what can I say many menu items not available, quality of steak not what I would expect arrogant staff. Sadly Marriott group have allowed branded restaurants into their properties the restaurants do not care or consider the hotel guests, the service is not at all in line with the Marriott values, in my opinion this is a mistake by Marriott, of which I am a loyal client being a platinum guest and stayed more than 1000 nights, Marriott Bournemouth has the same problem the restaurant is Raymond Blanc breakfast is poor and. It always good for dinner just way over priced   If you stay at the Marriott Royal Bristol"
"We had a great experience with the Marriott Royal for our wedding in June. Although we didn’t hold the wedding itself there, our party of 30 guests all stayed at the hotel for two nights, and the hotel and staff were brilliant. They did a great job within the covid restrictions but it not feeling at all stressful for us. The whole process from booking to checking out was seamless and we felt really well looked after. Food for breakfast was also great. Looking forward to having our wedding party with them later in the year!"
"As a previous Bristol resident, I have always admired this hotel from the outside and was excited to finally have an excuse to stay. It has to be said that as a base from which to enjoy the city, it can't be faulted and we loved the shared spaces downstairs including the tea lounge and the courtyard garden space. Unfortunately, considering the price, I was disappointed by our room that had what we needed, but lacked any thoughtful detail and only basics were offered. It also felt jarring that both parking and internet were additional charges whereas in other, more affordable places, they have been included (the internet was actually reimbursed but only after agreeing to sign up for the hotel app). The biggest let down though was the breakfast which felt like being on a conveyor"
Location was great and common areas were nice but the room walls were so thin could hear everything from the next room - aircon wasn’t working so room was really stuffy - tv crashed constantly - in general the room was old fashioned. Not great. E pensive for what it was...
"Love this hotel. Great location with handy car parking. Arrived had smooth check in with most pleasant reception staff. Given a ground floor room which was good for my hubby who can't walk too far. Room was clean and spacious with fridge, coffee and tea facilities. Bit gutted that the pool has gone, but never minded as there is so much to do in Bristol. Beds super comfy and had a great nights sleep! Breakfast was served in theMiller and carter resturant and what a stunning breakfast. Great menu and choice was beautiful! The hotel seemed busy but nothing was too much trouble. A welcome break after these covid times, felt totally safe here. Check out was good too. The staff here strive to make your stay a pleasant one, cant wait to return!"
"An ok stay. Lovely hotel. Got there after a six hour drive to be told that the only breakfast options were 7.15am or 10.15am. We'd booked it weeks ago and having checked the reservation info from booking.com, we weren't told that we needed to book. We cancelled the breakfast.  Otherwise, the room was nice, although the 2 double beds need a side table and plug sockets on both sides of the bed not just between them. I woke up at 5am and had to get out of bed to see what time it was.  There was a cleaning issue too but that was sorted out and the hotel gave us 20% off because of the breakfast and the housekeeping mishap.  Second hotel in Bristol in a year and neither of them have floated my boat. I'm going back to the Premier Inn!"
"we stayed one night when heading further southwest to break the journey. Very well-located hotel, high standards all around, and a particular thanks for the room upgrade it was excellent. The only let down was breakfast it was not of the quality of the rest of the hotel or what we are used to in other Marriotts."
"There are signs that places are beginning to relax, within the law, and they are certainly a bit less edgy than the last time a lockdown was lifted. I cannot count the times I have written pleas for attention to detail and here Marriott still falls short even allowing for the remaining precautions. Hand sanitiser was widely available but the dispenser in the 2nd floor (front) lift lobby was not refilled in three days. The room was spacious but also contained a lot of wasted space through poor design. The bathroom was particularly silly with the door restricting access to the toilet and a mirror light on only one side so that shaving was unevenly lit. A biscuit remained on the carpet in a public area for a day before it was crushed and it was still some time before it was"
"Hotel was in a great location and in a beautiful building. It must have been redecorated recently and it has been done very tastefully. Room was very comfortable, quiet - got a good night’s sleep. The staff were all perfectly pleasant - there was a long queue at check in when we arrived but it got dealt with pretty quickly. And we really liked the gym - it’s in the basement in lots of different sections - a bit quirky and interesting. Had to book in advance but didn’t have a problem getting the time we wanted.  There was just something missing - there didn’t seem to be much to do during our stay. The hotel seems very large so there wasn’t really a personal-feeling service, and getting to the room was quite a trek down lots of long corridors. There are lots of really interesting"
"Check in was simple, room was upgraded free of charge as I’d mentioned it was my husbands belated birthday treat. Room clean although tv didn’t work. The building, rooms and corridors are very well looked after but we would have liked a separate bar to the Miller and Carter restaurant. Midday checkout was handy. Location very central but wasn’t noisy. "
Thank you to everyone in the hotel for making my Birthday so special . The room was spotless and super comfy.  We dined in Miller & Carter restaurant.  The atmosphere and cleanliness was fabulous.  We  had a lovely table in the window overlooking the Cathedral.  The food was delicious and I must mention our waiter Bart.  I give him 5⭐ for his service 
"We often stay at Marriott hotels, and usually at Cabot Circus but on this occasion stayed at the Royal.  The hotel lobby is very attractive and all the staff are friendly and helpful.  The quality of breakfast was very good, as was the service. However, we were disappointed with the room.  We stayed in the ""newer"" extension,  but despite the quality bedroom & bathroom fittings, we found the room very dark, oppressive, and quite depressing.  I think this was due to the two very dark grey walls in the bathroom, plus two dark red walls in the bedroom with a small window and insufficient lighting.   BUT the one thing that really spoiled our 2 night stay  (Friday to Sunday) was the situation with the lifts.  There was only one working for the many rooms in the extension.   One public"
"Currently staying here for two nights and regretting it, since my last stay they have closed the pool and spa area and the restaurant/bar is now a Miller and Carter. They previously had a spacious bar and reception area, it seems they think the best thing to deal with Covid is to reduce that to a smaller area as part of the Miller crapper chain, basically there is no real bar area and the reception area is cold and empty. Real shame as if I wanted a hotel with a chain restaurant (cough) and no facilities, I would have stayed at a premier inn, what a way to ruin a once lovely hotel. "
"In these testing times the hotel was remarkably busy.  The Covid19 protocols all seemed to be compliant.  Lots of signage about one way systems and social distancing.  Mostly it didn't impinge on the experience.  We ate in the Miller & Carter restaurant, which was great.  The Miller & Carter run bar was a whole different experience; rude and aggressive staff.  No service without proving you have scanned in.  ""I have to see the response on your phone"" said the manager in a very aggressive way.  Not sure how that works if I don't have a smart phone, they wouldn't offer a pen and paper sign in.  Don't think about moving chairs!  A table of 5 in the bar wanted to borrow a spare chair from another table.  A member of the bar staff ran into the room shouting that you 'can't move"
"Was a lovely enjoyable stay for me, my partner and 2 teenage boys. Everything was clean and tidy and nothing was too much trouble. Rooms were very spacious and well presented. Staff were friendly and covid guidelines were followed thoroughly through out"
"Had a lovely one night stay at the Royal on Saturday night, the hotel is beautiful and clean. Hygiene and cleanliness is taken very seriously here and there were always staff cleaning and wiping down surfaces.  The breakfast was fantastic and the table service was great we were not kept waiting and the staff were very helpful and happy.  Will definitely visit this hotel again, don't hesitate to book it really is a gorgeous building!"
"Last year we booked to have our Civil Wedding Ceremony only at the Bristol Marriott Royal hotel, then COVID-19 appeared out of no where and changed everything! Having forced to downscale our wedding we decided to hold the entire day at the Marriot including the wedding sit down meal.   Throughout the whole process the staff at the Marriot hotel especially the event manager, Chris Luke, was completely understanding and was always willing to go the extra mile to help us have our day in the best way possible under the COVID-19 restrictions.   The team at the Marriot made our families feel so comfortable and accommodated to our every need and wish. They were attentive to everything! I cannot fault the service they have provided to make our big day ever so special.   Having our"
"The hotel suited us in terms of position in the city, we were able to walk to many attractions and restaurants. You will not starve here.  We have stayed in other refurbished Marriott properties in the UK, we booked a ""superior"" room, it does not exude quality as we have experienced. However, the cost was less than other places.  Breakfast was served, it was hot, it was tasty. Service was attentive. However, not different to a Premier Inn or similar.   We had plenty of towels, daily mineral water was replenished, bathroom cleaned, good housekeeping services.  The room design - why do modern hotel designers feel they need to create a dark room? Do these people never stay in a hotel?  I was going to entitle this review - do you shave or put on makeup in a hotel room? If so, this"
"Arrived for a two night stay, checked in by Sonia who went over everything with us, great Covid measures in place, room was lovely and bathroom was spotless, the whole hotel has a lovely feeling and so close to all the shops we will Definitely return again "
"Clean room, comfy bed and helpful staff in stunning surroundings! Tea, coffee, bottled water and hand sanitizer in room. Good Covid measures in place. Bonus car park on site and convenient location for visiting the museum. Will definitely return. "
"This hotel was not the same Marriott standard I’m used to and expected. Disappointed with the stay, wouldn’t choose here again. Room 1259  - dirty coffee cups in room that obviously hadn’t been changed since previous guest. The previous guest of the room must’ve dripped coffee on them and then they hadn’t been changed... gross! And super unhygienic in the current covid environment - see pic  - the bedding had two stains (we did complain and the bedding was changed) however still did not feel comfortable or clean in the room afterwards - see pic  - shower glass did not close properly so water went all over the floor like a lake in the bathroom (we also told reception about this, there was no one around to fix it, so they gave us some extra towels to put on the floor) - see pic  -"
"There were few things which made an experience a bit disappointing. 1. Breakfast times When I booked the hotel, there was no notification, suggestion or requirement to book a breakfast times. There was a generic Covid-19 notice, but nothing specific. When we arrived, we had to choose from remaining slots which were very inconvenient.  2. The bathtub.  When I booked, I've explicitly selected the room with bathtub. It wasn't optional, it was stated in the room description - ""Shower/tub combination"". The room we got was without bathtub. We been offered another room, but the reception guy mentioned: ""Some rooms has it, some doesn't"". 3. The room was booked for two person. When we entered the room, even the original one (without the bathtub), all toiletries, bathrobe, sleepers were"
"Exceptional service in the current climate .  One way system in place for drinks , food and breakfast . Rooms clean and sanitised. I felt very safe in this lovely hotel .  Highly recommend to anyone thinking of staying in Bristol city centre. "
"Just stayed here one night while in the area so that we could explore Bristol.  The hotel is beautifully decorated and impressive as you walk in the main entrance and the reception staff were professional, welcoming and informative. We stayed on a Marriott members deal which was excellent value for overnight stay and breakfast. Our room on the third floor was spotless, quiet and had good thick blackout curtains. Breakfast was generous and delicious.  We couldn't fault our stay except that it was too short."
"When you walk into the hotel it looks absolutely lovely. Can’t fault the public areas at all. However, the room is a completely different story. We paid £115 plus £17 a night for the room and parking, you’d expect something decent. The room wasn’t very clean, it was dark and really outdated. Huge stains on the carpet, sink blocked (you can see how filthy the plug is in the photo) and just grubby all over. We were right at the end of a corridor which I’d suggest to avoid, as it was really noisy with the overhead pipes outside the room. Such a shame and a let down. I’ll never return here again. "
"Cannot fault this hotel at all. I was treated to a one night stay to celebrate my 60th Birthday, 8th Oct. On arrival in the afternoon we were made to feel very welcomed by the reception staff whilst checking in, very efficient. Hotel  Covid friendly, hand gels everywhere, floor markings, mask wearing and cleaniness spot on, felt safe being there with everything going on around us at the moment. The hotel has a lot of character and the room that we stayed in was lovely, large bedroom and bathroom with an adjoining seating area which was ideal when family came back for cake and champagne (5 in total) Hotel well situated in city with many amenities in walking distance. I can highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again."
We spent two nights at this hotel during our recent visit to Bristol and enjoyed our stay as much as our previous ones.  The hotel is following all COVID-19 protocols and we felt safe throughout our stay.  Breakfasts were excellent and our room was spotlessly clean and comfortable.  All the staff we encountered were friendly and very helpful.
"I have stayed in this hotel scores of times. Its Covid discipline in the ground floor, public areas and the corridors when compared to Marriott Eden Park and Marriott Worsley (both of which I have stayed in within the last month) is disgraceful and irresponsible. Groups of young smokers in the entrance portico without masks, people checking in without masks people openly walking through the hotel without masks without challenge or encouragement. On Saturday 4/10/20 it was clear young females were coming in from outside, using the toilets in the hotel without masks and no porter or doorman (which there usually is) to interrupt them. I arrived at 2.30pm I was advised that breakfast, which I had paid for in advance had to be booked and the only time slots left now started with a"
"Great breakfast, good rooms, great location. An easy walk to the Train station and this hotels puts you right where you want to be to explore this city. Close to the Cathedral and interesting winding streets full of good places to eat. Beautiful lobby and grand rooms although can be a bit of a hike to your room due layout of this older style building. Would definitely stay again. "
"Check in staff very efficient, with warm service and quick to filter out any queuing to ensure that nobody is waiting too long. Easy to pick up taxi and under immediately outside and convenience stores and restaurants very close by. A note of caution though re keeping vigilant, many people can approach you when leaving the hotel, some of them genuinely homeless and some maybe not but they do seem to hang around in the darkish area if grass opposite the hotel and where you would cross the road - probably no different than other parts of the city in this respect but if does mean that you can’t be too causal when out after dark, especially since Covid as there are not so many people around in numbers. "
We stayed in the hotel for a wedding in Bristol and it was just perfect. The room was very big and clean! The staff was lovely as well and the location perfect in the city center. The car park was very handy as well. Definitely recommend a stay there!
My partner who is in a wheelchair and I took a long weekend away trip to Bristol. The staff were very attentive and helped answer any questions we had and made sure we were happy when we booked in.  The entire hotel was wonderful and clean!  Having a miller and carter in there was a fantastic touch. Having breakfast each morning and booked a table for dinner was great.  Location is amazing! Everything is literally on the doorstep which made getting around for us so much easier.  I’d definitely stay again! Thank you :)
I booked a room at the Marriott on College Green for my wedding day! It was ideally located in the centre and close to the church.  We arrived way before the check-in time with thinking that we would have to leave our bags at reception but the staff at reception did their best to check us in as they had our room already prepared for our arrival! (At 11am!!!) I think the receptionist was called Mya.   I also needed some stationary printed (groom's speech) printed last minute and Sylvie at reception did this for me which saved me some extra stress (definitely not needed on this day)  Our room was on the second floor and we had plenty of space to get ready!  The room was very clean and the hotel too!  I will strongly recommend it to my friends and family travelling to Bristol! 
"We had a wonderful stay. Our room was  on the 3rd floor, view was great. Thank you to Mandy for being so helpful. The room we stayed in and the lobby were very clean, well done to housekeeping! All staff were brilliant  We will definitely be coming back"
"Stayed 3 nights.................  Dusty room. (Asked for a deep clean and my name etched in the lamp base was still there after the deep clean!). Tops of lamps dusty.  Noisy aircon.  Wet bathroom walls due to dirty/clogged extractor in bathroom.  ""All the windows on that floor are locked shut for safety reasons"".....so why does the room 2 along from us have an open window?  Furniture with gauges and lumps knocked out of it.  But the Duty Manager could not come and witness these issues as he had not been trained to enter a guest room due to Covid!   A hotel guest in the main Tea Lounge, with bare feet on table..........disgusting. But the Duty Manager could not do anything about that!  Don't be dupped into paying the high rates. There are much better hotels in Bristol to stay in."
Last minute booking the night before when travelling by car from London and needed car parking. Hotel offers car parking onsite for a charge. Our booking included breakfast which was very organised and served in Millar & Carter Restaurant within the hotel. Covid safety measures were reassuring and you had to circle on menu what you wanted. We asked for extra towels as we had decided to stay longer and these were promptly delivered in a bag. Enjoyed walking through the hotel and learning some history it is a fabulous building and well located in a busy area for restaurants etc and for a visit to the theatre when they are up and running again.  
"We booked the sister hotel but had our booking changed to the Royal. We were apprehensive  about being in such a busy student part of Bridtol,in the present circumstances. However  we were given a quiet  room  and though the hotel was buzzing  we could escape  into a comfortable space.  Great beds,  every convenience and space to move.  A  large modern shower room with even a heated mirror.   Everything so clean.  We dont eat  much breakfast so avoided that. There is sadly no choice of where to eat  it's the steak house only, and room service is sourced from it too. One dinner was enough for us, it not being our sort of food.  A  word about the Covid restrictions is perhaps helpful. Mostly folk were wearing masks and trying to distance.  We  were not expecting housekeeping in"
Lovely hotel and lovely location. Car park under the building and it’s a convenient to a lot of areas of Bristol. Rooms were lovely and clean and modern. Breakfast at M&C the next day was lovely and all COVID measures were very good.  All staff encountered were friendly and helpful would return no problems 
We loved our weekend here in Room 1279. From check in to check out and everything in between we were very happy. There were the usual few numbskulls who seemed to love not wearing a face covering as a mark of defiance but the hotel did all that they could to encourage COVID compliance. Good and plentiful served breakfast from a decent menu. The room was very well appointed with a wonderful and very comfortable king sized bed. Great bathroom with a superb shower. Such a quiet hotel too and no traffic noise. Very effective air con. We will be back!
"We went to Bristol for our anniversary celebration and stayed in this hotel for a weekend. Hotel is very nice, we booked a suite which was very spacious - loved it. Dinner on first night at Miller and Carter was very good, service great, same applies for both breakfasts we had there. The service was very good. I communicated my requests via chat on my app on phone and all requests (extra amenities) were dealt with within minutes - great service again. The only disappointment we experienced was that our anniversary was completely unacknowledged, I have even asked for a complimentary drink for this occasion however it was refused. Considering this is a Marriott with great reputation - this was a big let down. We have stayed previous years in different hotels and all of them"
"Easy to find, parking is underneath the hotel. Warm welcome from reception staff. Good rooms. Very nice bathroom. Shower could benefit from being more powerful. Plenty of hand sanitising stations which are necessary at the moment. Very good location for the city centre.  "
"We had a very nice friendly welcome and although parking was extra at £17 it also allowed us to park early ...before 12 ....with the option of driving in and out of the gated car park whenever we wanted.  Our room was ready so we were able to leave our luggage in our room before heading out into Bristol. The room was large and nicely furnished.......as was the bathroom with all the little toiletries that are usual with the Marriotts. The room also had a fridge and a safe plus tea and coffee making. The carpets in the corridors were an unusual camouflage style and colour, whilst the pattern of the carpets in the old Palm court dining room and bar area opposite looked like they had suffered water/bleach damage!! Such a shame, those rooms looked so neglected. Masks were usually"
"This was our first time away since lockdown ended and like many were a little apprehensive about not only staying away from our hometown but also eating out and mixing with others. It's worth remembering that we are still in the middle of a pandemic and hotels and restaurants can only do so much to try and make us 'safe' the rest is down to us.  The hotel didn't disappoint in it's thought and preparation for guests safety.  On arrival there are signs to wear a mask in public areas, hand sanitiser stations at the entrance and at touch points on the ground floor, rooms are equipped with a small pack of disinfectant wipes for those who want to give an extra clean of their room.   While most guests abide by the request to wear masks there were a good number who didn't (of all ages)."
"My favourite hotel to stay at in Bristol! Beautiful, big luxurious rooms, very clean, excellent attentive staff and the breakfast buffet is divine! Beautiful grande building within walking distance to most of the best bars, restaurants and entertainment! I love this hotel!"
Superb hotel. We stayed a couple of times several years ago and wanted to return. The hotel had been refurbished since we were there last and looked stunning. As it was the last evening for the eat out offer and we had tried and failed to find a restaurant other than one which had a table at 21:30. This was rather late so Mya who on reception made several phone calls and managed to get us an earlier reservation. She went above and beyond being helpful. The male on reception with her was extremely pleasant. It added to a wonderful peaceful stay in the most comfortable of beds. Breakfast was a bonus.
"Stayed with wife and 2 children for one night..nice building, clean and excellent service...car park was quite dingy and tight spaces but was able to park for just £17 between 0930 and 1130 hours the next day....didn't eat there..close to nice bars and restaurants. .would defo recommend. .."
"We stayed here for a night with friends after one of them had done some filming at the hotel and was impressed with it. The rooms were clean and well appointed. This was our first overnight stay since lockdown and we found the Covid-19 procedures the hotel had in place made us feel very secure. The staff we encountered throughout  our stay were helpful and friendly. We walked out into the quayside area which is just across the road and spent a few hours eating and drinking at a couple of the large number of bars and restaurants there. We booked an evening meal in the Miller & Carter restaurant situated within the hotel, another reason we chose to stay there, which we all thoroughly enjoyed. We are fans of M&C and this one didn’t disappoint. Great hotel, good location."
"Stayed one night last Saturday and never having stayed at the hotel before we had a very pleasant surprise.  The hotel is in a great location, clean, very pleasant and efficient staff, excellent service.  The breakfast was very good.  Would definitely stay here again."
"I’d last stayed at this hotel in January and had rated it excellent. This weekend, I returned with my 2 children - our first break away from home since Covid started. I’d received a detailed email a couple of days before our stay, outlining Covid procedures and advising that I’d need to previous breakfast - all fine and very understandable.   Checkin was very busy when I arrived (about 4pm) and fellow guests were mostly without masks, which surprised me. This seemed to improve over the weekend. Once I reached the front desk, the receptionist was very friendly and efficient.   I’d booked a room with 2 double beds and it was fine. Not the height of luxury, but large enough and with good facilities. The view was directly over Park St and actually the room was really quiet - we all"
Terrible customer service.  Booked Royal Apartment and it’s now 4.30 and still waiting to get in my room.  Was first told 4pm now it’s 5pm will hardly be worth it soon as leaving in the morning! Plus no food available in hotel.
We have just stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and yesterday morning we booked breakfast for this morning at 8.15am for 6 people. We got down to Miller and Carters restaurant and were told there was no booking for us. She must have repeated this about 4 times that there was no booking. Not once did she apologise or say she would try to resolve the problem. Not once during the conversation did she give us eye contact she just kept saying there is no booking. We went to reception to try and resolve the matter but the young girl behind reception had no solution and she didn’t know what to do. We asked to see the manager who again didn’t apologise but said he would have to find out from the staff what had happened. Did he not believe what we had told him. There was no effort to
"Staff were excellent, check in smooth and the room was fine. Hotel perfectly situated in Bristol. Lifts are really quick and it is such a beautiful building. Disliked  · Breakfast was a disaster.It costs almost £15.00 but hey it promises so much. We ordered tea and coffee which came with no milk , waiter said he would fetch some. we waited at least five minutes and summons the waiter again but he said ""be with you in a minute"" that didn't happen until another waiter came to take our order for food and noticed that we had no milk, he brought it in no time. We ordered full english breakfast, the first cooked breakfast was cold and we sent it back. The replacement was even colder so we left it. What really made me angry was that when I explained to the Lady at the desk she argued"
"A one night stay, our first since lockdown started. Checked in to be told the only time we could have breakfast was at 6.30am or accept room service. We took room service for 9am, breakfast arrived at 9.50am after two chase up calls. Lukewarm food in a plastic tray. No milk or sugar for the tea. No condiments. Utter garbage quite frankly. Room was very nice but the standard of service was utterly dreadful. Nothing like Marriott standard, i'm a titanium member with over 900 nights in a marriott. The service at this hotel is as bad as any i have ever had."
"We Stayed for only one night but wished we stayed for more, the staff are extremely helpful and welcoming. The rooms are very clean and well looked after. Requested to have a room with a  view and they delivered! £17 parking for 24 hours if you stay at the hotel which is convenient. Overall an amazing stay."
"- 1 night here. Marriott status not recognised (always irritating) at check-in with well meaning but inexperienced reception staff.  - Room was clean, scuff marks etc let down what was otherwise a fresh, refurbished room. Bathroom towel rail not well designed as there is one rail.  - Fire alarm went off at 6.15am. I was awake anyway and hotel staff apologised on check-out, not their fault. Was told by 1 person is was a short circuit, another said the alarm had been broken by a guest- what was it?! - Breakfast fine. Got there when it was opened so it was empty, would prefer to pour milk on cereal myself, they should just bring out a milk jug. Food average but perfectly satisfactory. - Guests who have previously reviewed this hotel and commenting on the great protocols must have"
"Fantastic hotel with very polite staff, underground carpark was the only let down as not tidied after idle people decided to leave their rubbish everywhere.  Wonderful and old hotel, very clean and spot on with the covid rules. Great stay and I would recommend."
"We had a lovely stay at the Marriot. The room was very nice, front desk service was excellent and the breakfast very nice. The location is superb.   The one downside for us was that the majority of guests weren't wearing masks. I appreciate that the hotel can't be responsible for this, but felt other guests should know in case it changes your plans."
"Got very fond memories of hotel. Used to have a stunning swimming pool - closed in 2019. Used to provide fine cuisine in the impressive Palm Court - now empty with have a Miller &Carter in residence. Still give it 4* as rooms are still high quality, the location cannot be beaten, and the room rates have dropped so is good value ( reduction in amenities or covid?). Still recommend it."
"The perfect hotel experience! Fantastic location and just a 1 minute walk from the harbour side, docks and main square with plenty of restaurants and bars on the doorstep. The hotel itself was beautiful. We were mesmerised at the stunning architecture even from the outside but the inside was even better. Staff were amazing. Really friendly and professional and couldn’t do enough to help. Didn’t feel forced either like in some hotels. We arrived 2 hours before check-in opened but it was no problem at all and we were given the keys to the room straight away. The room itself was lovely, immaculately clean and a really decent size, the large bed was extremely comfortable and the complimentary water and biscuits were a nice touch. We decided to have breakfast delivered to the room"
"Stayed for one night as two couples for a birthday celebration in the city.  The room was spacious and well appointed with a large bed and tv.  I’m not sure when the room was last used as there was dust on the surfaces immediately visible by the light from the window. Maybe it’s pre covid? Who knows but it’s a tad poor for this standard of hotel.  Otherwise it was an ok stay.   We were awoken early in the morning by a fire alarm. Eager to leave we exited via the nearest escape down a flight of stairs only to be confronted by stacked chairs and tables in the area directly around the fire door. We were able to get out but had the stairway been packed with people trying to exit, the result could have been extremely serious. The fire door was a double door of which one side was"
"We had a brilliant overnight stay. Hotel was very Covid aware without it feeling uncomfortable. Good amount of hand sanitizers dotted around. Room was spacious with lovely view of the cathedral. Very quiet. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Room spotlessly clean. Hotel is very picturesque with beautiful interiors, I don’t think we saw half of it. Easy walking distance to everything around.   Would absolutely recommend Bristol as a nice city break, there are lots of great bars/restaurants etc great range of shopping too.  Will definitely be back and wouldn’t hesitate to book the Royal again.  "
"The Bristol Marriott Royal is in a fantastic location (College Green) for exploring Central Bristol.  With all the service quality & bed comfort to be expected from a Marriott property, wrapped up in the grandeur of the stunning building, there’s a lot to love about this place."
"We booked a one night stay on our way down to Cornwall from the midlands with the two children, we stayed in a room with two double beds. The room was fine, and clean and had a nice bathroom. The only problem we’re how hard the mattresses were, it was like sleeping on the floor, or an ironing board?? Why were the matresses so hard? The pillows were really nice. Found it very hard to sleep, which is why I’m writing this at 5.01 am. 😥😥"
"Stayed in a family room with two double beds, really could have been offered a double and two singles. Brilliant location for main sights, really good COVID policies, good gym, rooms are a tiny bit jaded but still nice and the en-suite was really good. Reception staff very amenable as were the bar staff. Would stay here again as a couple or with family."
"I just spent two nights in a Junior Suite (1256) - overall my stay was good, but could be improved.  I used the underground car park, this could use attention. It’s dark, poorly lit, quite a bit of litter and a feeling you could be murdered really... plenty of venues manage bright clean underground parking so this needs attention.  I arrived quite early and asked if an early check in could be arranged. The very friendly receptionist said not yet, but she would let housekeeping know to prioritise the room.  An hour later I checked back with another receptionist, I was struggling with back pain and really needed to lay down, I told the receptionist and she said she would “write that down”, then served the next person.  Official checkin is 4pm, I went back at 3:50 - still not"
"Lovely looking hotel, great interiors and great room.  The bed was comfortable, the pillows were like sacks (without the filling).  Spent three nights there and two were without hot water - the receptionist said ""oh"" and sniggered, it had obviously happened before.  The price of parking was extortionate - £17 per night for residents.  Checked in to find we were not expected.  Handed over our card at check in to charge expenses against - it was refused every time we tried to use it.  Maybe it will get better once everything is 'back to normal'."
"Just come back from a 3 night stay. The hotel is magnificent, steeped in history, wonderfull peacefull outside seating area to relax.  Rooms are lovely, standard Marriot.  However the hotel is far from standard, its spacious and you feel totally relaxed as soon as you arrive.   Yes they have hand sanitzers and 2 meter stickers, staff are in facemasks. We felt totally safe.   The Staff on recception are amazing and couldnt do enough for us.   The restraunt  breakfast is served in the Miller & Carter- We eat there 4 times, 1 evening meal with friends and 3 breakfasts. Every meal parts of the meal were cold, evening meal steak delicious but chips and sauces ( stone cold) Breakfast- everything cold except poached egg. My friend did complain nicely, the meal was taken away-"
"We stayed here for one night. The location of the hotel is excellent and we thought parking for 17 pound was good value. We checked in early which was great. We had a large spacious room which was very clean. Complimentary water was great. I could have done with more milk for the coffee facilities however! The bathroom was a good size and was big enough for a bath which is a shame as I’d have liked to have had a bath. There was lots of sanitizer around the hotel, although later in the day it had run out and wasn’t replaced. Staff in the hotel wore face masks.   We went to the miller and carter for drinks before dinner. We had to wait 10 minutes before anyone came to serve us (several couples who came in after us got served before us!) this meant we had to quickly drink our"
"The hotel staff were great, the room was spacious and clean. The food however was over priced and underwhelming. Having room service that you have to collect is non-sensical and having to pay 10:99 is excessive."
"Lovely reception staff, big and comfortable family room. However, VERY disappointed by the changes made to this hotel - the beautiful lounge where we used to have afternoon tea has gone and has been replaced by a characterlesssteakhouse. The Grecian style pool which made this hotel a real gem has gone, there is no longer a pool at all. The outdoor areas are now unkempt and scruffy with overflowing ashtrays and smashed glass, nowhere outdoors for families to relax, which during a pandemic seems very strange. The stunning room with stain glass ceiling and sculptures, where we used to have breakfast, has been closed and isn’t in use any longer. Disappointed by all of these changes as have been coming here for years. The staff were faultless though so these complaints are not their"
While visiting Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel on holiday with the family and having booked & paid for 3 rooms which included breakfast. We were offered no flexibly on breakfast dinning times. With just very early or very late times available; neither of the limited options suited as we had kids and grandparents in our party.  As an elite member I'm very disappointed in the Marriott Brand. Suggest you avoid this hotel for holiday use😔
"Stayed Thursday-Sunday. Staff were very helpful and two particular waiters in Miller & Carter restaurant at dinner/breakfast were excellent. Dinners and breakfasts were always good. The hotel room was comfortable and clean and the hotel was very central for visiting Bristol’s attractions, particularly the quayside and has the benefit of a bus stop close by that can drop you near the suspension bridge.  Unfortunately our final night was ruined by several groups of younger people noisily returning to their rooms from just before  midnight with no consideration for other guests on their floor. One group of girls even knocking on bedroom doors just for a laugh, clearly several of the rooms near to ours were occupied by a group of friends as they went visiting each other. Thankfully"
"Arrived on a Friday late afternoon, check in was great, lovely guy on reception, very friendly and informative. Arrived at our room, clean and spacious, looked just as the picture on the hotel website. unfortunately we had an inter joining room [a locked door joining 2 rooms together] and our near neighbours were very noisy!  Breakfast has to be booked via reception for the on sight Miller and Carter restaurant. We were met each morning by a miserable woman showing us to our seat, I had made my breakfast selection of a Vegetarian English breakfast, and put down before me were big greasy sausages and bacon! so had to wait a further 10 minutes before the correct order arrived.  Location is very central, near bars shops and restaurants. all in all was a great stay and we enjoyed"
"The hotel is a beautiful building that is clean, modern and spacious. The staff is exceptionally friendly. It is also perfectly situated in Bristol with lots of things to do. We took walks and jogs along the harbour and the Clifton Suspension Bridge. It's a very clean and fun city. We definitely recommend the Bristol Marriot Royal to stay in when visiting Bristol."
"Spent the weekend at this hotel on first trip post Covid..!! Very central location and beautifully decorated and updated inside. Stay were very attentive. Room was clean. Breakfast required a reservation due to Covid social distancing and was ‘table service’ using disposable menus. My only criticism would be we didn’t receive housekeeping on our second day - not sure if this was related to post Covid, but if it was we weren’t informed of it. Would definitely recommend a stay here."
After months of lockdown me and my girlfriend were finally able to celebrate her belated birthday here at the Marriott. After many emails between myself and the staff here at the hotel they were able to secure our special requests upon arrival.   Shinaid and Kim were both fantastic on the reception desk and delivered great customer service and hospitality to make our stay at the Marriott extra special by booking our meal at the onsite Miller and Carter restaurant and treating us to complimentary surprises to make our stay memorable.   This hotel is fantastic for a night away with modern rooms and comfy beds. Would highly recommend!   Thanks to the Marriott staff for making this stay extra special! 
Amazing attentative staff start to finish. Room gorgeous and the best view . Miller and carter food to die for. Again  staff couldnt do enough for you. Beautiful building and value for money.Thanks marriott staff.
"I absolutely loved my stay at the Bristol Marriott hotel. The room was spacious, clean, comfortable and had all the essential amenities. The breakfast was very delicious and I really enjoyed it. I felt welcomed at the hotel and the interior was beautifully decorated and overall very elegant. I really enjoyed my stay and rate the hotel very highly. Thank you for an excellent stay. "
"Terrible.   Booked a table for 8:30 and decided to have a drink in the bar first.   Chose a table and waited to be served as per current instructions.   Bar man came over to offer the drinks menu and said he’d be back shortly.   Having watched him serve others he still didn’t return.   We waited nearly 40 minutes before he eventually came to take our order, by which point I was on the phone booking a table in the bar over the road. "
"We visited shortly after they re-opened following lockdown.  They had good measures in place to support social distancing, but we still brought spray disinfectant for the room.  Front desk service was very good; friendly, quick and knowledgeable.  The rooms are a decent size, clean and ok decorated.  The hotel itself is beautiful also."
Lovely hotel. Friendly staff. Brilliant location.  Lovely spacious room and facilities.  Paid the extra for breakfast. But our stay was spoilt by noisy guests yelling at the top of their voices at 5.50 am.
"Very nice one night stay, the room was very spacious and clean. The hotel itself is immaculate. Can’t comment on the breakfast as we preferred to eat out, the only thing that was a bit disappointing was the strange smell in the room, smelt a bit of sewage. "
A most impressive hotel at the centre of Bristol. A warm welcome at check in . Guests have car park (chargeable) in an on-site underneath the Hotel.  Rooms are clean with large beds and the usual amenities. Bar and restaurant staff friendly with a broad range of drinks bar snacks and food. Miller & Carter has the Resturuant concession. We enjoyed our weekend stay and will now use this delightful hotel on all our future visits to Bristol. Excellent and thoroughly recommended !
"From arrival, right through the duration of my stay, every need is met, and catered for even before you ask..  The staff are super friendly, with attention to detail.  Food and drinks are attractively priced, and the food is amazing.   Room was immaculate with views over Bristol, what a superb hotel. "
"Fantastic service from this hotel! Especially Tia Birtwistle and Chris Luke.  Lovely comfortable rooms, I shared a twin but the beds were as big as doubles.  The staff couldn’t do enough for us especially Erten at breakfast.  What a fine chap he is! My only regret was that I didn’t book longer, really enjoyed my stay!"
"Best hotel in Bristol city . We had the most amazing time. Lovely hotel & breakfast, Friendly staff  Professional guest service. Thank you very much. we definitely go again and Tel all my friends thank you very much see you next time"
We booked here to be near the Hippodrome for a show.  The room and bathroom were beautifully clean and it had all the usual accessories.  The view from the window was a wall and a flat roof.  What I found out in the night was that the flat roof seemed to be for the power plant room and there was a constant buzz/hum all through the night.  Then at 6.30am it was time for a boost to the hotels systems.  That wasn’t funny. We ate in the restaurant in the evening and it was a tale of two very different meals. I chose a salmon dish with risotto and some small green vegetable.  The salmon was ok even though the skin was a bit soggy.  However the risotto was only just warm and the vegetable was hard and not at all pleasant.  I took it back to the kitchen and had a fillet steak instead
"Beware room types, no pool & spa anymore, climb 3 flights of stairs to the carpark and most of all the worst service I've ever experienced at a Marriott:  LAZY DOORMEN Two doormen/bellmen watched us unload our car with a lot of luggage, watched us pull it inside, then watched us struggle with it at reception, watched us get a trollley and clamber into the lift - just watched and smiled. No offer of help at all. Disgusting.   BEWARE ROOM TYPES Booked the highest category of 'room' before a Junior Suite and seemed to end up in the Attic. Nice view, but tiny room with tiny bathroom. Aircon rattled all night. Door rattled too as it wasn't tight.  I'd booked lower standard room categories before and ended up in better rooms so no idea how they classify their rooms (as a Gold member I"
"Had a wonderful overnight stay at the Marriott Royal.  It was our friends 50th birthday and she was greeted by complimentary cakes and a card in the room on arrival All the staff were very helpful on the front desk, arranging taxis for us etc. A great stay in a beautiful hotel. We will all definitely come back soon.  Many thanks."
"This is a really nice, centrally located hotel. We stayed for Valentines day and were really impressed with how friendly and helpful.the staff are. The hotel itself is decorates nicely and kept very clean, and the rooms are nice and spacious with  modern decor.  Breakfast in Miller + Carters was great, there was a large selection of food and the staff were very attentive."
"Had a short stay at this hotel, half term, with our grandchildren. Used the underground car park. Very difficult to access the hotel with lift out of order. Although the lift is not run by the hotel I would think that they could have made an effort to rectify the fault (out of order since mid December). Some rooms in the hotel are a distance from the lift, difficult for someone with walking issues. Most of the channels on the TV were not working. We were offered a refund on our parking but still awaiting the refund to our account.  The hotel is in an excellent location on College Green. The Aquarium and the water front attractions are on the door step, also near the theatre. The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful. We believe that the bar and dining is run separately."
"I stayed here twice. Once as a single traveller in December,  and again as a couple in February.  The hotel is spacious, clean and has very comfortable beds. The building is very grand and beautiful.  The first time I stayed, I was very happy here, with my only complaint being that the television didn't work (no signal on any channel). Sadly, 2 months later in a different room, I found exactly the same problem. When I tried to call reception a few times over a 30 minute period, I got no response so decided to go and speak to them in the reception area. On the way I met a porter and asked if I was dialling correctly. He told me rudely that the reception staff wouldn't be answering the phones because they had check-ins to do, and as for the TV signal, it was Storm Ciara which had"
"As much as it is a very pretty hotel inside, the organisation of the hotel is poor. I have stayed here on this occasion for my Birthday, which was booked by my husband. We booked a junior suite (best room type) yet when going up to the room... not the room we booked??? On returning to the reception, they state that no it’s not the room booked but we did have complimentary parking and would be refunded the difference..... the reason behind the failure... not given but nor did they tell us before going to our room that it was a downgrade.. hoping we wouldn’t notice? Or wouldn’t complain? It’s not something we would want to have to do on a birthday celebration. On the next note, we ordered room service and as I don’t eat very large portions, I ordered a three course young guest"
"The Royal is an impressive and wonderfully imposing building located next to the picturesque Bristol Cathedral on College Green and a hotel that I’ve wanted to stay in for some time so the opportunity to enjoy a concert at the nearby St George afforded me this at last!  After negotiating the tight but welcomed car park, I was disappointed to find the lifts out of action so lugged my bag up the stairs. It is clearly a popular hotel for events as well as city stays so I found myself walking through an army function which was a tad confusing as the group were crossing the main walkway to a bar.   I was early and the friendly reception staff kindly allowed me to deposit my luggage without any issue. After popping up Park Street I returned for check in and was once again impressed"
"We have stayed in this hotel a few times before the renovation and always had a fantastic time, however we came this year for Valentine’s weekend without being aware the spa and pool were gone which was a massive disappointment. The price of the hotel room is still the same even though there are less facilities. We stayed in an Executive room, in which we had stayed before, however the refurbishment has made these half the size of what they used to be. The hotel rooms feel less luxurious than before. The baths used to be big round jacuzzi style baths and now they are regular house baths. The hotel is lovely and so is the food, the room service is quick and the staff is lovely, however we are very disappointed by the changes made in the renovation..."
Superb rooms and service from all staff. Would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Bristol. Local attractions also close by. Parking an issue when busy. Thank you to all the staff who looked after me during my stay.                             
Have used this hotel previously due to its location and quality. Staff excellent  We were disappointed to find our room had not been serviced on our return at 2.30pm but a visit to reception resolved this matter. Dining at the hotel is care of Miller and Carter Steak House and we have commented on this experience under a separate trip advisor review .
"My wife and I were part of a family group occupying several rooms opening onto a communal relaxation area.  Evening meals were undertaken as a private family event, whilst we also made use of breakfast facilities in the more traditional way.  This seemed to go very well, aided by the lovely and relaxing surroundings that the hotel offers."
"Good price, good location, lots of parking, super comfy matrress and pillows! Everything you could possibly need, shampoo, water, coffee, tea etc. Good service, fast check in and povided us with taxi number. Recommend to anyone, no complaints."
The location is amazing when staying here as it really is in the heart of bristol and walking distance for most places. We stayed here as it was a 6 minute walk from the o2 which was great. The staff were friendly and our room was very comfortable. The bed is super soft and comfy. Plenty of car parking too at an extra of £17 for the night until midnight the next day which was a plus. Would stay again.
"I stayed here for two nights on a short business conference. The hotel is about 20 minutes walk from Bristol Temple Meads railway station but there are plenty of taxis outside the station if needed. My check in was quick and friendly and i was ushered to one of the lift locations and in my room in about 5 minutes. The room was fairly large, clean and tidy with a comfortable bed but not a great view of Bristol but it was also very quiet as it was not facing the main road. There were basic tea making facilities and and a few toiletries, an iron and ironing board (in my view essential for business stays) and my only niggle with the room was that wifi is not free. I mean really, why can't these hotels just put their prices up by £5 and give us free wifi to save us the hassle? There"
"Booked at the hotel due to the location and the lovely stay's we have had here in the past. Although this may be our last. I am always interested in how hotels deal with reviews. Do they make improvements all is it polite words. Do they try and get people back to prove the experiance can be better.   We arrived at the hotel, easy to park although with no lift to reception. We checked in easy and slightly earlier than 4, which is great. Room was good size, nice decor with everything you need. Air con a little on the loud side but not a massive issue. We got ready and went off for the evening. On returning to our room we were hit with a smell of must of been the steakhouse down stairs coming through the air vents. Great if your hungry i guess, not so nice at night, after a long"
"I stayed for one night at the end of January and was very impressed. It had been several years since my last stay and the hotel has gone through extensive renovations (unfortunately losing the pool and spa along the way).  The location is great, and made a nice change for me as I usually stay closer to Cabot Circus.   Parking was easy (the car park is tight, but has lots of spaces). No lift up to reception, no problem for me but might be for others. I arrived just after 3pm and my room was ready.  I had booked a Royal wing deluxe room and was happy to learn I’d been upgraded to a junior suite. The room was large and bright, with views up to Park Street. The bed was huge with lots of comfy pillows - I had a great night’s sleep. The bathroom had a big walk in shower, but no bath."
"My family stayed for a night over the Christmas holidays. The renovation of the historic hotel is quite lovely, the rooms are comfy and overall we felt the hotel was a very good deal. Staff was well trained and courteous, and the location was perfect plus easy drive from airport. In a very sweet gesture the hotel gave us a Christmas card and yummy gift to celebrate the holiday! We walked to a Christmas Bazaar, a shopping mall, restaurants and shops. You could also easily walk to museums. The garage is not for the faint hearted but kudos that it had a garage!  Did not eat here but would go back in a heart beat. It would be an incredible location for a special event!"
"Enjoyed my stay here. Room was clean, bed was comfortable, staff was helpful. It's located right next to the cathedral and near the aquarium, with loads of great restaurants in walking distance. Car park was very easy to get to and pay for (ticketless)."
"I have stayed numerous times in Bristol, but this was my first visit to this Hotel.  The staff are extremely friendly, helpful & attentive, the Hotel is beautiful, grand, warm, clean & perfectly positioned in the centre of Bristol! I travelled & stayed with one other adult and we stayed in a family room with 2 large double beds ( great to have a bed each to stretch out in !!) the room was very comfortable, great space, lovely bathroom, beautiful clean bed linen and most importantly extremely quiet!! Very quiet room ( no.1327) views directly onto the road and up to College Green - couldn't hear any traffic at all, very quiet hence a great sleep!  Breakfast is in the hotel's restaurant ""Miller & Carter' which was lovely. A really nice restaurant, lovely surroundings and lovely"
"I chose this hotel as I used to live in Bath and had previously been to events at this hotel. I was visiting family and wanted a hotel for one night. I was lucky to be upgraded to a junior suite, the room was lovely and the staff were really helpful. You can park under the hotel, there is a large car park, however the spaces are tight if you have a large car. Also the lift does not work so I had to struggle up 3 flights, this needs to be sorted. Breakfast was in the main restaurant, to be honest it was quite basic for a Marriott. I also used the gym which was very good. So overall I would recommend this hotel if you are staying one or 2 nights. "
"Location next to harbor  and boardwalk area.  The hotel is quite historic and the staff is outstanding.   The suites were quite spacious with nice appointments,next to a beautiful church,  The steakhouse is a sublet but they did a good job with food & wine.Nice spaces to relax and enjoy a coffee,"
"Hotel in a great location, large and spacious foyer with  friendly and polite staff. Close to lots of coffee shops, bars and cultural sites. Large bedroom, but no robes or slippers, water temperature was an issue but rectified when reported to front desk. Self service breakfast had good choices. Would be happy to return again."
"We stayed for 2 nights 3rd & 4th January and had an okay time. On arrival the hotel was very pleasing on the eye with large Christmas trees both outside and in and a very smart foyer. Check in was easy even though we only went to ask if we could leave our bags as we arrived around 1pm and we knew check in was 4pm but the receptionist checked us in straight away. We asked how to get to the pool only to find it had been closed for a long time. I have since seen a reply from the hotel to a review on T/A that everyone who booked before it's closure had been informed of this.....WE WERE NOT and we had booked last April so were very disappointed. Our room was nice with a comfy bed,large TV and coffee making facilities but only one robe and slippers in a double room?? The bottled water"
"Looked for a hotel close to the theatre as we had a family pantomime visit. This hotel dud not disappoint,  from the beautiful reception area, friendly staff, nice bar to the lovely wide corridors and beautiful  bedrooms, we were extremely pleased . Our daughters had family adjoining  rooms, both with 2 double beds. We will definitely stay here again if we are lucky enough to return to Bristol! The bonus of this hotel that the restaurant  is a Miller and Carter restaurant  which was fab. Also late checkout at 12 suited us all really well."
"I came with my parents as they were visiting me in Bristol and we decided to have a drink in the bar area of the hotel but there were dirty glasses all over every single table and the bar - we had to move them ourselves. Then, despite it not being very busy at all, not one member of staff did anything about the mess during the 2 hours we were there. Very disappointing as it was my dad’s birthday and we were hoping to have a nice time"
"So they have contracted out the food to Carter & Miller a steak restaurant! Who wants to eat that every night! Not great for your health and for the environment, seems they sold it off to the highest bidder. They have also closed permanently the swimming pool! So that also means the spa. What a very odd move, considering spas are a growth area. This use to be a great hotel which we went to for many years, it seems the accountants have taken over and i cant see the reason to stay at this so called 'luxury' hotel over a Premier Inn! Apart from one of those is a lot cheaper. The mattresses are also hard as others have mentioned... another cost saving i presume. This isn't the Marriott as it use to be."
"The Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel is a nice looking hotel in the middle of the city. Easy accessible by car as the hotel has its own parking garage. The staff is very friendly and helpful. and made us feel at home from the first minute on. The rooms are not super spacious but large enough for a few nights. The bathroom only has a toilet, a sink, and a shower. there was no bathtub in my room. The hotel also has a beautifully decorated banquet room called the Palm Court. See my picture. During my stay there where to negatives; the noises heard from outside can be pretty loud at night and there was a bad smell in my bathroom the last night which smelled like putrid stench. Still, I enjoyed my stay."
"Stayed over New Years Eve with my partner, we were greeted by a very friendly and helpful Mya at the front desk who checked us in very swiftly before we went up to our lovely room which had a nice view of the harbour across the road. In the morning again, at the front desk, was a very cheerful colleague, Sylvie, who made the morning a lot more bearable after suffering with the typical New Year’s Day hangover. All in all great atmosphere and would recommend."
Several members of the family stayed at the hotel over Christmas. I was with my son and his family - wife and 2 children. Our rooms were close together. The rooms were bright and big and the amenities were wonderful. The children had a wonderful time at breakfast and the staff were very understanding and helpful.  We were there for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
"Booked over xmas, good quality hotel. Some little niggles but the staff were very helpful. Fitness centre with plenty of equipment. The restaurant is run by a steak house chain so limited options but plenty of eating places nearby. The room windows are locked so no fresh air causing the room to be a little stuffy. Does not have rooms with twin beds but the king size bed gave enough space."
"Really good , i love coming here . Food was a disappointment but it was a lovely trip still , attached pictures are of the lobby , my starter and the view out the window . Not like before , beds were okay but majority of food was under average. I still loved the pool , and the stay . This was a birthday visit "
"We have just returned from a wonderful weekend at the a Bristol Marriott Royal. The hotel is full of character and has recently been refurbished. Our room was spacious, well equipped with the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in!!   I do find it funny how all the previous reviews complain there is no pool... do your research before you stay! No where on the hotels website does it say there is a pool anymore!!   If your looking for a beautiful hotel, service with a smile in probably the best location in Bristol then look no further!  "
"Over the years we have stayed here when visiting family in Bristol.  The hotel should be fabulous but sadly not this year.  The swimming pool and sauna suite, a major plus, had been closed for good.  Two out of three lifts are out for refurbishment including the one that leads to the underground car park.  Great that the hotel is being upgraded but we booked back in September and were not aware.  Reception staff were very helpful and recognised our frustration but overall disappointing."
Hosted an event here and the main issue we had was that the kitchen was under construction but the hotel never warned us about the construction. During our 2 day event there was a constant hammering  and the fire alarms were set off several times.   The sleeping rooms were recently renovated so that was nice. There is no lounge of elite members which is frustrating. The hotel is very beautiful and was refreshed in 2018. The service was just disappointing.
"Having stayed in the hotel a few times previously, I booked a night for the day after Boxing Day as a break for me,  my parents and son.  He loves staying in hotels with a pool and was terribly disappointed after checking in this afternoon to find the pool had been removed in October! This is not made clear on the website, as it still states it has a spa and a fitness centre, so it is easy to assume this includes the pool if you have stayed before.  The receptionist told me that they’d informed anyone who booked in advance of October but did not point it out to anyone who booked after that, and did not seem particularly interested.   On top of that, the rooms only had a shower, no bath!!"
Central location but the hotel feels tired especially the spa facilities. Some communal parts of the hotel was nice. Staff were friendly. Only stayed for 1 night probably wouldn't stay again though. I mainly booked this accomodation for the brand. Other Marriotts are much nicer overall.
"It is not often that one feels the need to write a bad report but in some cases it is justified. Most establishments strive very hard to achieve excellence and work with consumers to better themselves. However in this case I am writing.  The Royal Hotel is an icon, a slightly faded and gracefully aged lady of high repute and a certain gentleness, long lost in todays world, the staff were always highly professional and courteous with a charming manner. Sadly all has been lost, the staff have replaced with clones, lacking disregard for the most basic of services, the beautiful luxurious albeit a little aged but with a smallest amount of tweaking would have smartened up beautifully, has closed and gone forever. The bars have now become the restaurant and here I come to my review. "
"The good points about this hotel are its proximity to the centre of Bristol - its lovely location beside the cathedral and College Green - the spacious rooms, the luxurious downstairs areas (lounges, etc.) and, at Christmas, it's beautifully decorated. Another good point is the staff - nearly all those we encountered were very courteous, pleasant, helpful and professional, especially the reception staff. The less impressive points include: a superior room, within the superior room wing, with only one small window - too high up to see out of - and so the bedroom and en-suite were dark and oppressive; a second superior room that we were shown to, which was spacious and had a large window, but it looked out onto a high brick wall - this was absolutely all we could see from it. (If"
"Really nice looking hotel in the hustle and bustle of Bristol. Nice high ceilings all over. Check-in was smooth and quickly (did an online check-in). The room was normal but the bathroom seemed renovated so this was nice. Spacious and will all amenities you need. Water cooker is available in the room. Tv set and airco. The airco did its thing but it still felt very warm throughout the whole hotel including the room. You can't open the window so that's no help. The hotel is large so we even had some difficulty finding the room, a lot of corridors and angles. Breakfast is a whole lot with eggs and beans, mushrooms and yoghurt so plenty to choose from. All together a really nice place to stay when you're in Bristol."
"Door staff were appalling, I had lost my door card and they point blank refused me entry, when i asked for the manager i was physically assault on two occasions by the doorman. Had to call the police to get let into my own hotel"
"Very nice hotel in the centre of town, close to the majority of places to see. The service was superb   the room with a very confortable queen size bed, bathroom clean. The annexed steakhouse serves very good meat and drinks."
"We used the Marriott meeting rooms for corporate events over a number of dates. For the first event, service was great, although we had issues with the speaker system (we could hear people swearing over the PA system in another room which happened a number of times during the day), they also made errors with the food (our vegan delegate was given meat and fish - despite it saying vegan on the signage.) however the staff apologised and we were happy to book the Marriott again for future events. Our last booking last month was a disaster, the room signage had been mixed up with another company so they had given us the wrong room. When we eventually got in the right room it was freezing and despite telling staff, delegates had to keep their coats on all day. The final insult was"
"Much improved since the refurb. Gone are the Marriott drab 80’s cream and floralesque colours and replaced with a modern grey theme. Fantastic location and service, excellent rooms and facilities.  Aircon in room won’t turn off soo be prepared to get hot or cold air blown on you in bed until temperature reached. Leisure club not properly finished and gym is 24’c with no way to alter the setting yourself. Also, it is only accessed from stairs near reception so if you take any other lift it is greyed out which gave me the initial impression it was closed. As per all Marriotts here the real let down is the evening restaurant. Food tends to be a limited choice and generally unhealthy options. Breakfast on the other hand is always spot on.   Be warned though the car park for hotel"
"Very enjoyable weekend stay at this excellent hotel. Fantastic central location with on site secure parking, attentive and courtious staff who made a real effort to ensure we recieved a very warm welcome. Fabulously festive decor which made our Christmas shopping weekend memorable. Good size room, again recently refurbished to a high standard with all the amienities you need. Restaurant was superb (Miller & Carter) and we were lucky to have one of the nicest waiters we've experienced for some time, made the meal a real treat."
"Whilst at a wedding stayed here for 2 nights. Booked online for a good price and had a pleasant stay. Room was clean and of a good size and slept well, comfy beds!  A hotel I would use again if in the area."
"We visited the hotel back in August, the first impression was quite good. Recently renovated bedrooms with good size bathrooms. The check-in was alright and got upgraded as a loyal member, but lit lacked a bit of precision. The only downfall of the stay was the outsourced service provided from the Miller & Carter restaurant for the breakfast, the space was quite limited and the menu options as well. But the overall service was shocking and slightly rude, fortunately I spoke to the manager from the service desk and she was very understanding and managed to resolve the issue. So I would like to thank her for that and I would recommend the hotel for a nice stay but I would avoid the breakfast."
"The Royal was a bit of a surprise - the quality and services you’d expect in a Marriott but combined with a fabulous building full of character. Also have a Miller and Carter restaurant on the premises. Based in the heart of the university area, a really nice location. Good place to stay."
"This hotel is central, the rooms are very good, both in size and amenities, the staff are lovely and I would normally have no problems giving this 5 stars BUT £10.99 per day for internet is a big no-no in this day and age. This what I expect to pay on a cruise ship 1000 miles from the nearest land mass not in a city centre hotel. This really let the whole thing down."
Despite initially being told we should have booked in advance - at least 1.5 hours apparently - the staff went out of their way to produce an enjoyable afternoon tea and are to be thanked for the effort they made and the willingness to go the extra mile despite the time it took to prepare. The spicy deep fried cauliflower was especially flavoursome and this slightly unexpected element in the mixture of a more typical afternoon tea was the highlight. The Coronation chicken sandwiches were good as was the smoked salmon oatcake - the cucumber sandwiches were less good. Scones were a little heavy but the clotted cream saved them - it would have been nice to have had home made jam rather than standard catering small pots. Amongst the sweet dishes the macaroons and the creme brulle
Lovely hotel and friendly staff.. I booked a room for my wife's birthday celeb... they gave us free birthday card birthday cake and nice free prosecco.. what more can you expect...!! Thankyou for hospitality I'm really impressed the way treat us!! Hopefully see you soon.. RUSEN SEVINC
Enjoyed an overnight stay for a Christmas shopping trip to Bristol. We were upgraded to a superior double room which was very pleasantly decorated and had a recently refurbed bathroom. We also enjoyed an evening meal in the inhouse Miller and Carter restaurant which seemed to be a popular choice with many others.   There were a couple of niggles however:  1/ First the hotel isn’t well lite up at night and the car park signage is hard to see after dark. This made arrival rather stressful with needless circling around central Bristol before we eventually found the way in..    2/ Unfortunately the aircon wasn’t working properly and the room was far too hot overnight making it difficult to sleep.
One of the most expensive hotels in Bristol so I had high expectations. And the rate does not include breakfast.   My room was in the basement with a small and very dirty window overlooking a road at the rear. I may has well have been in an airport hotel. This made me sad as I was treating myself to a luxury night away.   If I wasn't tired I would have asked to change rooms.   Bedding is nice but the bed is very hard.   Bathroom is adequate with a nice deep bath. Toiletries were nice.   Parking is a big issue. The underground car park is £17 for the night. I have a disability but discovered all spaces taken by expensive vehicles without blue badges. I was told by the hotel that they do not control the car park and cannot do anything about this.   The lift to the car park was out
"Stayed one night whilst out on the town in central Bristol. I am a Marriott Platinum Member so was upgraded to a suite on the M floor.   Classic Marriott comfortable room and bed. Everything you’d expect from a hotel of this class. The suite bit was nice but we didn’t really use it! Didn’t really use anything else in the hotel such as breakfast as we arrived just in time to get ready for the night out, had a lie in and then left.  The car park cost £17 for the night (about a 50% discount on published rates) and is accessed to the left of the main entrance. Don’t believe Google maps which will deposit you at the car park exit if you follow it. If you do arrive here, it’s left at the lights, and left again across the pavement area into the car park entrance. Be sure to give your"
"Drab, some interior designer got paid thousands to furnish this hotel. it cost me £145 pounds to stay and look at the,  in my opinion,  a not in a month of Sundays would i get the wow factor feeling about this hotel. I would be embarrassed to charge £80 pounds for a room here. The internal signage is poor also."
"We’ve just returned from a weekend in Bristol staying at the Marriott, our first choice hotel.  We’ve stayed here several times before and as always the room was well equipped and very clean. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom modern with soft fluffy towels. Staff at reception were friendly and helpful.  The Miller and Carter steakhouse was excellent too.  We will look forward to our next visit in January. "
"It was real shame to find out that the Leisure Cub with its Roman bath-style pool, sauna, steam room etc closed on the 14th Oct after more than half a century. The only item left on the lower ground floor is the gym (and you need a code from reception to use it).  However, when I last used the Leisure Cub is was obviously in need of renovation and the cost of this was probably prohibitive.  On the plus side, the refurbishment of the dining area into a Miller and Carter Steakhouse is excellent.  But with a full hotel, there were queues for breakfast at 7:45 with several items being used up faster than they could be replenished.  Daily newspapers are available from the Tea Lounge. Wi-Fi £4.99 per day for in-room use, but was slower than what I recently had for free in my room in a"
Booked a table of 9 on a Sunday lunch time. Staff very good as we needed individual bills. The Sunday set menu is very good value. Food took a while to come out but was very good when it did. Some comments on the table was that the steaks were one stop below what was asked for e.g. a medium steak came out almost rare and the steaks had been left standing for a bit too long as they were a bit cold. Good atmosphere.
"Stayed here for one night to see friends , the room was very nice and spotless, comfortable beds, very modern bathroom, All the staff are very friendly and helpful, thank you all for an enjoyable stay,"
We really enjoyed our stay due to the helpful staff and very comfortable beds. We had a spacious room overlooking the cathedral.  It was very quiet with excellent blackout curtains and a very comfortable bed. The staff were friendly and efficient throughout.  Check in and out were swift and efficient and the restaurant and breakfast staff were attentive and helpful. Everyone was friendly.  The restaurant food was fantastic.  This is not the cheapest option but I think it is worth the extra. The location would be hard to beat.
"First time we visited about ten years ago the reception area was beautiful with a log fire burning in an adjacent room. It felt very grand and special. Now there is piped pop music in reception competing with different pop music coming from the franchise steak restaurant that has replaced the log fire lounge. Rooms are comfortable but no longer feel special but the location is great. Cannot fault the staff, everyone was friendly and said hello, whatever their role. Nothing really to set this aside from any other hotel it has lost it's uniqueness to me and feel it does not offer the value for money any more. Unlikely to stay again."
"Friendly, helpful, great location, large, clean rooms.  Some complain that the hotel is old-fashioned.  To me, that means character, like an older person with stories to tell.  I've stayed here before and will certainly do so again if I come to Bristol - which in itself is well worth a visit!  Rather dreadful service in the restaurant, though!"
"The Hotel has a great location and everything you need for an overnight stay.  We went to the Hippodrome and the Hotel was just round the corner.  The Hotel also has an underground car park which is great. The room was clean, and the breakfast was good."
Had visited this hotel previously and was very disappointed this time. The pool and leisure centre had closed down between booking and staying there and WiFi is now charged for unless you become a Marriott member. Breakfast is now served in the adjoining steakhouse which could not cope on a Sunday morning. We stood and waited over 10 minutes at the buffet as all bacon egg sausage and mushroom was empty. It then came a bit at a time so not at all satisfactory. That said the food that was available was very good. The hotel operates a strange cleaning system where all glass bottles and unneeded room items seem to be left by the cleaner outside rooms waiting for a later collection. They were left for over 24 hours all down the corridor which was disgusting as the room opposite us
"The design of the hotel is such the area they hold events in is such that the roof acts like a massive speaker up through the entire hotel.  Music until 1 a.m. . ..  yeah 1 a.m,  DO NOT STAY HERE.  DO NOT STAY HERE DO NOT STAY HERE as a business traveller wanting peace and quiet att the weekend,  Utterly ridiculous."
"They run events within the hotel with no limits on noise. DJ and dance music vibrating through the hotel. We couldn’t tell if we were in a nightclub or hotel, and we’re in our 20s. Unbelievable. Unable to sleep or enjoy our stay. Avoid at all costs"
"Beautiful hotel in central Bristol. We stayed on the second floor and our room was fab, very clean and bathroom was well stocked. Beds were comfy! Staff were friendly and welcoming. We travelled with our two children, one of whom is disabled, and all staff we encountered were very helpful. Our only minor grumble was the lack of free wifi - £5/10 a day seems a bit steep, however we were able to access Youtube, Iplayer, etc on the TV, which was a bonus."
"Booked as a 2-night family trip for half-term. Have stayed here twice before so thought we knew what we were getting and we even booked this hotel over the Mercury where we have also stayed before. Booked via Booking.com in early October.   Discovered, when asking reception if there were any pool time restrictions for children, that the pool/spa were permanently closed down wef 14/10. Nothing highlighted on booking that pool would be closed down before our stay.   The following morning I asked at reception if any exception could be made for us to use the pool at the other Marriott hotel for just an hour to redeem the trip, receptionist checked with manager but within 30 seconds the answer was a “no”. My 7 year old thought this was the best hotel ever when he walked in, he now"
"At first glance, this hotel is very grand and stands overlooking the harbour side area of Bristol. The entrance is grand and the reception area is beautiful.  The check in took a long time and the receptionist did not seem to know what he was doing. After being stood at reception for ten minutes the check in was complete. Attached to the reception is a Miller and Carter steak house. Drinks at this bar are very reasonably priced and not the usual hotel rip offs.   On our way through to the bedrooms, and during our stay, only one lift was in order. No signage was place on the out of order lift which could result in customers becoming frustrated in having to wait for longer period of times to get in the one working lift. Clear signage may reduce the likelihood of confusion and"
Lovely to revisit this fabulous historic hotel !  Upgraded to a junior suite which was superb with two large screen TVs (perfect for my son to have his own room/tv and watch the rugby!). Breakfast was varied and we were given a table straight away with no queue. Perfect hot buffet and tasty coffee. Dinner in the steak restaurant on Saturday night was delicious - highly recommend the steak with the easy to order menu and wine pairing specialities. Concierge team were kind enough to store our bikes safely (after just coming from a week in center parcs) and all the front office team we encountered were professional and friendly. Highly recommend !
"There was a big hole in my bed. When I noticed it, it was already late at night and I was too tired to deal with it so I slept in it. Next morning I called the reception to tell that I had to sleep in a bed with a huge hole (see the pic), the duty manager said ""ok, but you're checking out today, right?"" as if the fact that I paid to sleep in this kind of bed was somehow made acceptable because I didn't have to stay one more night!?!? The attitude of this duty manager doesn't belong in a service industry. Appalling. Don't bother booking this hotel. "
"We came surrounded by friends at their wedding, it is they who chose us this hotel, very nice professional welcome, beautiful spacious room, we enjoyed the bathroom and the activities of this hotel, excellent breakfast with good service"
"Nice stay, great location, great staff, spacious room, unfortunately no lounge, Nice tea lounge, very quite and clean. Walking distance from almost everything, quick ride to the station.  Defiantly will stay again!"
"We stayed in a renovated room on the Mezzanine level. Unfortunately there was a background noise that sounded like a generator running all night. This made it difficult to sleep without putting ear plugs in my ears. I would , therefore, not recommend this room for anyone who is a light sleeper. The noise was very intrusive and impossible to ignore."
"The hotel is stunning from the outside. Parking is tight and is £17 per night as a resident. Breakfast can be overwhelming for the chefs, on some occasions they stopped making omelettes.   The room was nice and clean and comfortable, I stayed for 9 nights and had a great sleep every night.   The only downside is the pool and sauna etc have been closed. The gym was small but functional.   "
"A hotel out of the eighties that looks like it hasn’t been updated since.  Staff do not care, and everything seems to be too much trouble. For example, I made the mistake of asking one of the waitresses for poached eggs. Outrageous! E attitude was, “How dare I disturb her!” The eggs were eventually delivered with especially bad grace. The breakfasts are really poor and expensive. Tiered looking sausages, tough bacon and yes of course, you have to pay extra for a tasteless cappuccino.  Leisure centre is closed and the pool not working, mirrors in the lift broken and covered with silver tape.   Staff on the reception desk rude and could not be bothered to greet you when you come in at night.  I don’t know how somewhere like this stays in business.  Overall a really depressing"
"The hotel has a very imposing foyer and was extremely busy on our Saturday afternoon arrival. Check in did take some time.  The room was very comfy and roomy. Excellent bathroom particularly the shower. The bed was extremely comfortable.  The hotel is in a great location. Close to shops, the old town and restaurants.  Recommended.  "
"My family and I stayed here for the weekend in October, the building is beautiful inside & out.  Lovely refurbished hotel, good sized rooms, great staff, very nice restaurant and breakfast is perfect.  We would definately return to this hotel.  Perfect for a seeing the sights of Bristol and to enjoy a relaxing break."
"The Marriott is in an excellent location for exploring central Bristol. A grand, beautiful facade, right on College Green. The staff are really helpful, and sorted out my car parking quickly and efficiently. We had a great room, really comfy bed and it was so quiet. Perfect. We will definitely be back. "
"Stayed here a couple of weeks ago with two of my older children and had a very pleasant weekend. The hotel is in a great location (right next to the cathedral and walking distance to the harbour and to numerous shops, restaurants and bars - also walked to Clifton suspension Bridge and Clifton Observatory) All the staff were friendly, helpful and polite. Check in was swift (and although we were a little early our room was already ready).  The room itself was well appointed, clean and comfortable and the bathroom was also clean and had everything we needed.  There was plenty of storage within the room along with the usual TV, iron, safe, tea/coffee making etc. Breakfast was perfect – plenty of choices on the buffett of both hot and cold dishes and all very tasty. The swimming pool"
"Atmospheric traditional old building, and enjoyable to walk through the ancient corridors. Bar was good, but the service lacking as the waiters got forgetful under pressure. Our room was bizarre - on the top floor and with no windows, so a bit like a prison cell. There was a pigeon who patrolled the skylight so we had a good view of his bottom and the skylight was covered in guano. Also atmospheric, but in a different way."
"We visited the Royal Marriott Hotel with three teenagers celebrating a birthday, we booked ten weeks in advance and the hotel and booking.com advertised as having spa facilities, which is what we searched for. Paid a premium for these facilities and yet after check in and payment discovered they were no longer available and had closed the spa facilities some weeks before. Disappointed and the hotel were not bothered when I told them this was the reason we had booked. No recompense offered and now having done some research about what they should do to out it right they have stopped responding to my email via booking.com who we booked through.  Rooms were clean and comfortable...however we booked this hotel And paid for the facilities and they were not there!"
"Visited Miller & Carter restaurant at Bristol Royal Marriott on Saturday for my sons 18th Birthday. Wowed from stepping into reception area. Made our way to the restaurant bar, all staff very attentive and friendly. Had a table for 7, very luxurious surroundings. Waiting staff very friendly and professional. We all had different starters, the Yorkies, seafood sharing platter, Bbq chicken wings and the sautéd churrasco prawns all were delicious, mains steaks, salmon, buttermilk chicken, and sea bass were fabulous. Made sure the bell was rang to tell chef we were extremely happy with service and food. Ordered a few desserts, all very Moreish! My son had the special Eton mess and written on the plate Happy Birthday, with a candle. A nice little touch with waiters joining us in the"
Stayed here to join in the celebrations for a friend's 70th. We travelled with trepidation having read some recent reviews but are happy to report that we enjoyed a first class experience - were able to check in three hours early - comfortable and spacious bedroom - good food at both dinner and breakfast - helpful and courteous staff.
"The Bristol Royal Hotel has been restored to her former glory. It's quite grand and the staff will make you feel very welcomed and comfortable. If you enjoy luxury, and I do, you'll enjoy your stay. Outstanding, walkable, location. However, this hotel should have a doorman....or, if they do he was not on duty when we arrived. There a several steps to climb to enter the lobby."
"Booked one night at the hotel for our 5 year wedding anniversary. Contacted the hotel in advance to say that it was a special occasion and asked for a room with a view if possible. The room we were given was small and had no window apart from a sky light. The spa facility was disappointing with the Jacuzzi being out of order, there was no mention of this when we checked in. Wasn't the special occasion we were hoping for."
"Had booked in for the night for a relaxing trip and to use the spa facilities.  The hotel itself is lovely and very clean. There was no signal on the tv and not enough toiletries for 2 ppl and I was very disappointed to have no free wifi. The spa on the other hand is disgusting. Went in to the sauna and it was dirty and unpleasant, used steam room where there was grime on the edge of seats and dirt on the walls, pool area was dirty and clearly hadn't been cleaned and last of all the changing rooms was a disgrace.  Dirt on floor, hair everywhere, dirty towels lying and lockers were dirty inside and out and when going to complain there was no one about.  Not worth the money I paid!"
"We were looking for a city centre hotel and this did not disappoint, the entrance is rather grand and the server was great.  There is plenty of underground parking although there is an extra cost for this.  Our room was spacious and had everything wee needed during our stay.  Location is perfect if you are exploring the city, everything we wanted was within a 15 min walk so there was no need to use the car."
"Our 4th stay at this hotel and first one after the renovation.  I must say, despite some improvements, lots of things actually got worse. The check in was painfully slow as they had a large group of young ladies checking in and only 2 receptionists on duty.  The first room we had allocated had such a terrible smell that we had to request a different room.  This request was met immediately and we got moved to a slightly smaller but at least not a smelly room.  A quick look through the window and another rather ""unsavoury"" sight - the window was absolutely filthy!  Look at the picture attached! However, it was great to see that the pool area/changing rooms were now much improved. What really disappointed us was the breakfast.  We used to look forward to excellent breakfasts that"
"Wow, the wonderful, supurp, blissful SPA us CLOSING!!!!! NO. Sad, sad news from October it will be no more. People's please complian, please shout, please stop this. I adore the swimming pool and facilities. My mum was a member for many years and I visit often. Hotel guests choose this hotel for this reason. Management stop this madness  Please can you all complain."
"Having stayed in this hotel a few times previously it was very disappointing this time. The excellent location and grand building give it the two stars. Now for the poor bit. There are no lifts from the car park at the moment, so having dropped of my pregnant wife, couldn’t park outside so had to carry bags up two flights of stairs twice. We had booked a deluxe double room, we got a double room but it had interconnecting doors and very noisy neighbours whose phone and alarms were going off at 5.30am. This was not very pleasant and could hear them going to the toilet. I requested a room close to reception due to pregnant wife, this was ignored and we was put probably the furthest point away from reception.  Breakfast was poor quality, cold, everything had run out, tea and coffee"
"I was very disappointed with the room that we were given, 1415. It was supposed to be a Deluxe room but was no more than a small attic room. When I saw what other Deluxe rooms were like, at the same price, I complained. According to the hotels website all Deluxe rooms have a table with seating for two and a writing desk with chair. Room 1415 had neither as the room was too small to fit them in. We had the desk chair but no desk. Other Deluxe rooms were twice the size.  The kettle was hidden behind the tv as there was no where else for it to go as you couldn’t fit even a small table into the room. The safe was not secure and was placed inside the wardrobe, what stops someone walking out with the safe?  The pool area was awful. Mould on the walls, jacuzzi not working, both urinals"
"Just returned from bristol royal Marriott where I met with my sisters to celebrate my 40th and it was a very pleasant stay. Large hotel so great for your steps getting to your room but we didnt mind. The hotel is so well located not far from the harbour, decor in keeping with wonderfully old historic building. Facilities all great although we didnt use the spa. Parking on site. We stayed in a family room to start before my sister upgraded us to a suite and both were roomy and had everything we needed. Staff were friendly and helpful and I want to leave a special mention for Kim at check in who was lovely. She did everything she could to make our stay first class and enjoyable so Thankyou"
"The Marriott Royal used to be worthy of it's name with luxurious facilities and well appointed rooms. Unfortunately this has now declined and the imminent closure of the pool, Jacuzzi and spa facilities means this hotel will now be on the avoid list."
"Well,  this was on our bucket list as growing up in Bristol and my husband being an old Cathedral chorister next door, we only knew it as derelict. I was told to park level b3 as lifts were out but I could knock on service lift and come up that way. Disabled parking on that floor they had made a normal double bay into 3 and literally My car could just reverse in but my wing mirrors were too wide to fit and if they had I wouldn’t be able to open the door to get out. I had to abandon my car at the side. I then spent 15 minutes walking round this level banging on every door - no one came. I managed to get phone reception to ring my husband who got the hotel doorman to take me on service lift. Not a great start. We were told that all but one internal lifts were not in use until"
We had a very good stay here as a family in two rooms.  All clean and well maintained.    My one criticism of the hotel is why do they wish to be associated with Miller and Carter as the only on site restaurant.  Breakfast was fine but dinner was very disappointing.  The chefs need some lessons in the preparation and cooking of steaks.  The fillet steak was full of gristle and sinews - unacceptable.
"THis hotel is really good. It's completely refurbished. Rooms are spacious and very modern. Decoration is also good linking to the city of Bristol (graffitti paintins, cartoons, really good). Breakfast is also great. I came here for work for a number of weeks and i felt really comfortable... Marriott beds are great. YOu have to pay for the WIFI unless you are a marriott member - so worth going through the quick process."
"Spent one Saturday night here in late August.  The hotel is in a great old building that is conveniently located near many of Bristol's main attractions.  It is well maintained and our room appeared very clean and spotless when we stayed there.  I last stayed there five years ago and since that time the entire catering operation at the hotel has been outsourced to Miller and Carter, a UK gastropub chain.  This has meant the separate original bar area has been ripped out , and merged into the wider main restaurant.  The bar area itself now feels it belongs in a pub, rather than in an historic hotel, and a lot of  the  original character of the place has been lost.  The food itself in the restaurant was fine, but I do feel a hotel like this should be offering something more"
"In hotels I can usually sleep fine. And my wife could sleep on the top of a mountain in a hurricane. But last night neither of us slept at all!!  Hot (even though “air con” was on maximum), horrible beds and the worst pillows that man has ever made. Genuinely it was horrible.   All of the above is such a shame because the location and the hotel itself is very nice. Lovely bar area and reception, BUT if you can’t sleep what is the point??  And the cherry on the cake? A persistent knock at the door (which I ignored  for as long as I could) this morning from the cleaning staff asking “when are you leaving?” It was just before 10am  I said I don’t know, why? She said because I want to know when I can clean your room.   I cannot ever remember this ever happening before and I’ve"
"We stayed here for bank holiday weekend and was disappointed overall with our experience, there were some positive aspects but these were our weighed by the negatives I’m afraid. Positives:  Check in was relatively quick and pleasant although no offer of a morning newspaper as should be Room was clean, we were in a standard double on the 4th floor and did have a view of the Canal. Fridge was provided which was handy as we got milk from a nearby shop (although the hotel could provide these as I’ve experienced in the other hotels). Also the wardrobe had proper coat hangers which you take off properly- I hate those ones which only half come off!  Location of hotel is great right in the middle of the city centre. Negatives: Not enough towels provided in the room - 2 proper size"
"I was extremely underwhelmed with this hotel. Despite it being a 4 star hotel, there were many factors that made this hotel undeserving of this.   The pros of this hotel was it's location, it is central to all the main highlights Bristol has to offer. They have quite clearly spent a lot of time, effort and money on the interior of the hotel. It boasts great décor in a very classic kind of way. Reception staff were friendly. It was clean.   The cons: I cannot comprehend how in this day and age, there is a cost to use WiFi. A £4.99 rate is ridiculous. I expected this from a Premier Inn type hotel where they make their money from their add-on costs but not from a 4* where you are already paying a huge premium to stay, even more so on a bank holiday weekend.   I have never in my"
"I booked this hotel for my husbands birthday as a suprise. We traveeled from Cornwall to Bristol for an event we were going to. I called the hotel as we were travelling down to ask if we could check in earlier than the 4pm stated on the booking (very odd as hotels are usually a 2pm check in at the latest). I was asked wat time we would arrive, to which I said 2pm and they said that would be fine. We arrived at 3pm due to traffic and I was then told the room was not ready. Even though I had been told twice checking in at 2pm would be fine. We took our bags back to the car and went to our event. We arrived back at the hotel at 7pm. Another long wait at reception with only one staff memeber attending to guests. Finally we got to our room and put the air conditioning on. I was"
A lovely classy hotel in Bristol. Rustic classical.  Good location to town as well as easy to get to places like the Bristol Zoo and Suspension Bridge. There's a lovely park and cathedral around the hotel too. And walking distance to the town centre.
"Why this Hotel is only a 4 star amazes me. It should be 5 in my eyes. The staff were very friendly, helpful and polite from the time we checked in to the time we checked out. We got upgraded to a superior room to which we were over the moon with. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone that is staying in Bristol. Also had breakfast which was absolutely worth it. Thanks again for a great stay."
"This was the perfect location for me: it is well placed for someone wanting to visit and look around the city. Just one or two suggestions: it seemed extraordinary not to have any bottled water available in a 'deluxe' room, especially on such a hot day - especially when there were three empty bottles left to greet me outside the door on arrival. Only one teabag. Charging for wifi in this day and age seems rather ungenerous too. No response from room service when trying to order a meal: had to go to the switchboard. The hotel appears to have been recently refurbished, but perhaps not entirely in sympathy with its period: the foyer is somewhat minimalist, and could do with some seating for those like me who were waiting for a taxi, or other reasons. Staff generally helpful,"
"We had a great two night stay. Staff were friendly and helpful....breakfast very good. pool and spa facilities were good also.The room was well sized, clean and well equipped. The car park lift is an issue , particularly as we sometimes need wheelchair access however there is the option to drop off and then park. We'll be back!"
"We've had an excellent 2 night stay here! A beautiful hotel in a great location. Room was a deluxe double which was very spacious,clean and seemed to be newly refurbished. Breakfast was lovely and the meal in Miller and Carter was excellent. Great service too. Would definitely come back again!"
"Hotel without hot water ,spa disgraceful.  No one wanting to accept responsibility .such a waste of time/money  and a shame as once a beautiful hotel. No refund and very poor customer services . A spa day treat gone horribly wrong . Members still being charged £65 a month.  Not informed of no hot water or hair dryers ,arrogant management who couldn't care less ."
My friends and I stayed here for two nights. It is perfectly located for everything- short walk to Harbourside! The front desk staff were approachable and friendly and let us check in early for no extra cost. The rooms were clean and tidy and the cleaners changed our towels/ made the beds during the 2 night visit. We personally thought it was a bargain! 4 adults in 1 room is rare to come across. Can not fault this hotel and will be returning again in the future.
"A real shame because the Marriott is one of  Bristol’s flagship hotels. Situated in a perfect location near the lovely College Green at the foot of Park Street, the hotel is ideally suited to parents dropping or collecting their kids from college or access to the riverside, the town or Clifton.   The hotel itself is beautiful with well appointed rooms and great bathrooms.  Unfortunately our “superior” room had a wardrobe door missing and the in room tea and coffee marred by the goddawful UHT milk. There is a fridge so why not add real milk?    On arrival the reception was very busy. I had ore checked in hang the Bonvoy app and advised our time of arrival. The room wasn’t ready so we had to decamp to the bar where we spent £30 on some bar food and a drink. And hour later we went"
"The lifts from the car park have been out of order for weeks, as has the jacuzzi. The pool has holes in the ceiling and paintwork bubbling up and peeling. I am a leisure club member of many years. Despite a recent refurb, this is not a hotel I would recommend to visiting friends or family any more."
"Very much a posh hotell, that was not really to our taste. Staff was friendly, as usually at this places. the location was good for what we had in mind. the Parking is hard to find (garage under) the alarm was peeping inside all of the two days. the room was very big, clean, and modern. but a very annoying sound come up diring the night and as I didnt want to wake my son and wife so I was wake from 4 am. you pay extra for fast internet, not sure about standard, as my wife loged in and is not sure if it asked her if she wanted to have fast internet. a bit a strange for an expensive hotel..."
"This is a very large, old, recently-updated hotel in an excellent location at the bottom of Park Street - central for all parts of the city.  However, walking into the reception area was disappointing - it's a dark, gloomy space and when I arrived around 5.30pm, there were several people waiting to check in and only 1 receptionist.  When someone else eventually appeared to help she seemed flustered and raced through the standard greeting formula (yes - that's just what it felt like), barely making eye contact.  My room was very nice - clean, modern and comfortable - the most enjoyable part of my stay.  Breakfast was crowded and noisy and the person serving me could have done with changing his apron, which was covered in stains.  It seemed to be a very popular place for families"
"My room was clean but lacked any personality and looked dated. For such a beautiful building the hotel made no attempt with the rooms.  However, my low score was the fact I could hear a hotel party in my room, this was not ok."
Overall the hotel was clean and well presented however the rooms are very old and dates with an old air conditioning system which makes it very uncomfortable in the summer as there is not a lot of air flow.  In addition there was a funny smell coming from my room which meant that I could not get a well rested night sleep. On the flip side the bar for the hotel is great and priced well so is good for a few drinks after you have had a long day.
"Nestled inside the grand building we found super friendly and accommodating staff who really helped us to make the most of our stay.  Lovely atmosphere, wonderfully clean and in a fantastic location (we could easily get to all of Bristol’s main attractions and the balloon fiesta bus), all at a great price.  The fiesta was a wash out but our stay wasn’t!  I’d definitely come again.  Thank you."
"This excellently located hotel was all that you could ask for in a central city location, despite the challenging tight turns in the underground car park. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable and quite frankly should be for the price charged.  There was a persistant back ground intrusive noise in our room that both we, and seperately our friends noticed in their nearby room. The rooms were very promptly changed although it would seem this noise was not a one off and we would have expected this to have been sorted out . Reception rooms were large and lacking some character and atmosphere. Front desk were helpful and breakfast was what you would expect from a hotel of this size, plenty on offer and personal requests met, albeit slowly. However this breakfast room was very"
"Have stayed at this hotel many times and everything has been excellent but recently, something is going on in the restaurant. The service by front of house staff in the Miller & Carter is well below the standard expected.  Initially we thought the delay in taking our drink order and then 30 minutes for delivery, then delays in receiving our food was a one off, but it wasn't. We dined the second night and experienced even further delays. Although we had complimentary drinks it wasn't the point. We were hungry and ended up eating an hour and half from sitting down; and restaurant was far from full. The food however, once it arrived looked and tasted lovely. There were no issues at Breakfast.  Restaurant experience was below average. Please address the sub-standard service as there"
"We stayed between 2 and 5 August in a superior room. On arrival the check in was quick but not the most engaging. We had to ask if we could put credit onto our room to allow for room charges. One of the lifts is broken, which causes a lot of delays and the lift to the car park is still non operational.   Our room (3rd floor) was nice but the curtain rail was hanging off, there was a sick stain on the bed base and the bathroom walls were covered in some kind of slime! We reported these issues to reception and to be honest all were rectified when we went back to our room later that evening. Im just surprised that housekeeping allowed this room to be released to guests, knowing there were issues with the room. Surely these rooms are inspected before arrival?  Our dinner in the"
"This hotel is situated right in the heart of Bristol, within walking distance of the attractions, restaurants and shops. Perfect for what we wanted to do. Our room was spotless and had everything you could possibly need, the beds were extremely comfortable. The facilities were excellent, we loved the pool and the fact that it is open from 6am till 10 pm. The staff were lovely, very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, it's also surprisingly quiet being right in the centre. "
"The room is amazing,spa facilities are good except jacuzzi is not available and hasn’t been for a long time and wasn’t stated at reception or online. On arrival was impressed by beautiful decor and a warm welcoming. However as the evening came we all got dressed up and went to the restaurant Miller and carter for dinner we booked a table for 7 o’clock, we arrived at 6:50 and placed are order 10 minutes later, we then got asked about drinks at 7:15 and food was later delivered cold at 7:45 and had been left under warming lights for at least 25 mins and the waiter, when we were one meal short still after 45-50 minutes wait was extremely confrontational when we expressed that the wait/service wasn’t good enough. When there were lots of children around no apology was made,he was"
The hotel is amazing. The staff are really friendly and the room is really clean.  The hotel is very well located (it’s near a Bristol ferry stop) and near the sea life and ‘we the curious’. The whole hotel is great and the food is amazing.
"What a great hotel. We recently stayed with our 3 young children, 5,3 and 7 months and took advantage of an upgrade deal to stay in a Royal Junior suite. So glad we did! Heaps of room and our own kitchen (no utensils though!) The only thing we could make use of was the Nespresso machine. Ordered room service for dinner was excellent. Breakfast was also excellent. The swimming pool and spa facilities fantastic. Only downsides - car park. Very dark and tight spaces made parking and getting the kids out tricky. We actually drove into a glass bottle that was on the ground and thank goodness we didn't get a puncture. Lift to the reception from car park broken so had to carry pushchair up the stairs. One of the two main lifts also broken. Finally, when we checked into our room there"
"We didn't stay at the Marriott, but attended a family wedding in the Palm Court room and nearby bar. The wedding itself was lovely, and very well-managed to avoid disruption to other guests.   By mid-afternoon, our two young children (20 months) were struggling and clearly needed to sleep. Unfortunately we were staying at a fifth floor apartment 10 minutes' walk away, where the rooms were baking hot and the lift had broken. We asked the reception if they could possibly have mercy on us and let us use one of the rooms for the children to have a couple of hours to nap.   Not only did they make a ground-floor room available, they set up two cots complete with sheets within a few minutes and even gave us a few 'toddler toiletries' (lotion, baby bubble bath, etc.). We were hugely"
"I have historically rated this hotel highly and has been my favoured place to stay when visiting our daughter who is at uni. Unfortunately this will be our last visit here.  Reception staff continue to be good and welcoming. I suspect this is where the training money is spent because the rest, especially breakfast restaurant staff, are terrible.   After the latest refurb the restaurant is far too cramped, not enough space at breakfast so you have to put up with people’s rear ends taking over your table as they apologetically shuffle past.   At breakfast the staff are surly, rude, and unhelpful and so badly trained that if they bring you an ordered different drink (be sure to be ready for the scowl of disapproval) they won’t remove your cups. We ended up moving the extra cups to"
"Location not bad.hotel usual standard. We didn't eat in the restaurant as it's menu isn't particularly good if you are a vegetarian. Bar ok and a bit of atmosphere in there. My two gripes are that the car park lift wasn't working and the wifi in the room just wouldn't work without asking for payment, we went to the reception but no joy. It was supposed to be free included with the room tariff. Plenty of choices for breakfast nearby as well.  "
"Booked a room and breakfast at this hotel, I was speedily contacted and offered an upgraded room with parking and half a bottle of wine included. We took up the offer and paid the extra £40 to cover this.  On arrival reception knew nothing of the upgrade and tried to charge me for parking.  We went to our allocated room, and as there was no wine as promised, we rang reception, again they knew nothing of this upgrade package, so all was explained a 2nd time!!!  To cut a long story short ,after explaining our situation at least 4 times during our 1 night stay, we never got the wine or the upgrade!  We complained again on departure, when I was assured I would not have been charged the additional £40.  On checking my statement I was indeed charged this £40 and after contacting"
"The Royal in Bristol is very interesting, due to the location (very close of the more sparkling area of the city) and the building structure. Elegant in the furniture with an interesting price/quality rate.   Despite those great elements, the Hotel needs to better solve some aspects no adeguate to the hotel standard:  a. At the check in, they ask to pay and due to several technical problems, is impossible to do that. Is not better to say ""we could try tomorrow"" instead to insist, insist and insit, when the problem is yours? b. In the room (very very large) no frigo bar, no one bottle of water and some blood stains on the sheet. I left a message (bad really bad) no message to say ""sorry""; c. In the main elevator, I see pool and spa in -1 but is right if you use the old one.... I"
"A group of 10 of us stayed here for a hen party. We paid £100pp and were crammed into 3 rooms. We were told it would be a relaxing weekend and it was the complete opposite. We couldn't use the spa facilities as the jacuzzi wasn't working, the steam room had a huge crack in the ceiling and swimming pool was full of kids messing around,we literally had to leave the spa straight away. The rooms weren't cleaned to a good standard,lots of dust and marks on bedding. Not enough tea/coffee and only 1 toilet roll per room!! When going for breakfast we were told we had to pay for it but we argued our case that it was supposed to be included in the price which they reluctantly agreed to in the end. It was a miller and carter restaurant which was again full of dust which we wrote clean me"
"I stopped in this hotel with my parents. It was a nice hotel overall. The room we had was clean and the beds were comfortable. I really liked the room, so I can't complain about that. What I can complain about is when we went to Bristol Festival and the staff were meant to take our suitcases the room for us as we were out all day, but we got back at around 12 AM tired and they didn't put our suitcases in the room. We didn't want to be messing about as we wanted to sleep, but we had to sort it out. The staff were okay.  The breakfast was nice. I was glad there was vegetarian options. I like how they asked if I wanted tea or coffee and I said ""tea"" and they poor me some tea. I weren't expecting that at all, but that was very nice! :)  Overall nice hotel, I would recommend this. :)"
"The hotel is beautifully located right on College Green next to the cathedral and very convenient for the waterfront. The reception areas are light and airy. Very impressive.  Parking is at a premium so choose the underground parking offered at £17 per day. Unfortunately the lift to the car park was out of order during our stay and its 4 flights of stairs. The receptionist warned us at check in so we unloaded our bags before parking.   The room was everything you would expect from a 4* hotel, very comfortable, good sized bathroom and lovely large fluffy towels. The triple glazing was effective at blocking out the traffic noise from the street below. But I was disappointed that there was no espresso coffee machine in the room and it seemed you had to pay £5 per day for wifi."
"Lets start with the good points.  Excellent position, right next to the cathedral, on a pretty green, easy walk to river/dock area.  Plentiful parking.  Nicely decorated public rooms.  Decent sized bedrooms, nice and clear, nice bathroom (shower rather than bath which I prefer), nice toiletries, very comfortable bed with good quality linen.  Bad points:  Pool too warm and permanently filled with poorly behaved kids.  Corridors and lesser used areas are tatty.  Really slow service at breakfast and things not replenished quickly enough.    Fire alarm went off both days, vacated our room both times only to be told that it's due to things burning in the kitchen and it happens most days."
"Not to be confused with the other Bristol Marriott a brutalist concrete monstrosity near the shopping district and north of Temple Meads station, the Bristol Marriott Royal adjacent to the cathedral and College Green is an altogether more sedate affair perfectly complimentary the statue of an elderly Queen Victoria which sits outside it. Arriving at 9.30pm on a Friday night after a journey on an overcrowded train from London we were probably not in the best of sorts. So it was frankly irritating to be told our upgraded family room was available but there was little point in taking it up as one of its beds was a sofa bed. Or to be handed a form to fill in already giving my address not in London but somewhere in Massachusetts. More of a problem was the absence of any bottled water"
"We stayed here on Friday for my boyfriends 30th, can honestly say it's the nicest, most welcoming hotel. Our superior room was beautiful and very clean. We really enjoyed the breakfast.  We were really touched by the bottle of wine and birthday note waiting for my boyfriend.  It was a bit of a shame the spa was not working but never the less we had an awesome time and will definitely stay again on our next weekend in Bristol. Also, the bellboys were super friendly and helpful. Thank you :)"
"My husband, my 8 year old son and I were visiting family in Bristol and decided to stay here. They have finished their refresh/remodeling that was going on last year and the public spaces look wonderful.  Our room was wonderfully spacious! Since it was the weekend, there were no hour limits for children to use the pool.  The hotel is centrally located, and not a far walk from restaurants and attractions.  I would stay here again."
"Stayed here in June for 3 nights we booked a room with 2 King Sized beds , when we checked in we were told that there was no such room and we had to stay in a room with two double beds. The receptionist said it was an issue with Booking.com, but I did not book through booking.com. I wonder why a hotel chain did not do more to resolve this issue. The room we stayed in was ok but we were disappointed as it was not what we thought we were getting. The bathroom was really good but they had these really poor quality towels and the bathrobes we terrible old and rough, we did not use them. We went to investigate the Spa as we were going to give our family who live in Bristol a treat on the Sunday. Upon enquiring we were shocked to be told that the Spa is not open on a Sunday!!! Staff"
"My daughter and I enjoyed a treatment and then a relaxing time in the pool, sauna and steam room as her birthday treat.  She loved her facial, which included a head massage, and I had a back massage which sorted out all my knots and tension.  We paid £39.50 each, and it included free parking.  We had a very relaxing morning and I would highly recommend it."
"Great location and grandish looking hotel, business class in general. Good breakfast, great rooms. Seems to have a decent health suite as well but I did not have time to take advantage.  My only complaint is that I was put on the Lower Ground floor, and there was a mechanical noise throughout which disturbed my sleep somewhat. As we were only there for two nights I did not worry about it, but would suggest you check this out before accepting a room in that area - I don't know if other rooms were as affected.  Aside from this, I would definitely stay here again."
"Hotel has been clearly refurbished and the rooms are very good.   Staff are excellent as the franchised bar and steakhouse on the property.   Location is where it scores on college green and a stones throw away from the waterfront which in the summer is the place to be.   Downsides are minor, house keeping wanting to make up the room at 8.30 am grr grr and the car park is shall we say a little tight.  All in all a great property"
"Warm welcome at this lovely hotel, reception staff friendly and efficient. We were able to book in early. Room was clean and comfortable, very.comfortable beds. Tastefully deigned lounge and dining areas. We were disappointed with the food, ordered nachos as a lunchtime snack and they were not good, used some sort of cheese paste, just tasteless. We had steak for our evening meal and the steak was delicious but everything with it, including extra garlic mushrooms and greens was bland. Would definitely stay again but would not eat in. Perfect location for central Bristol."
We had a flight quite early in the morning and decided to stay here prior to our flight. The hotel is easy to find and the silverzone parking is only minutes away. The food is nice and reasonable priced for a airport hotel
"I booked this hotel as have wanted to stay here for ages. Excellent location on College Green and walking distance to most of Bristol’s sights. I booked a two bedroom suite which had amazingly comfortable bed. The check in was swift and professional. Note the hotel was quite busy as they were hosting an event. Highlight of the evening has to have been the hotel restaurant. Great service and amazing food. The service was superb and bar service excellent. Breakfast in the morning was of a buffet style, fresh, good quality and plentiful  "
"For the price, the hotel is a good choice. The rooms are well appointed and clean. Away from the room, the hotel is really showing signs of age and could do with being updated.  There is a car park underneath the hotel but the spaces are right so leave the Rangey at home!"
"I have just come back from a business trip and stayed here.   It looks really grand and was well populated. It is also super central. I was pretty chipper when I arrived, because it all looked so promising.  However,  my room had super thin walls, so I heard the guy next door snoring,sneezing and letting rip and his alarm on his phone woke me up at 7am (it was Sunday). He was super chatty when he woke up because I pretty much heard everything. Maybe the wooden head board affixed to the wall amplified the sound (why not the soundproofing cloth padded ones every other hotel seem to install?) Thank goodness they hadn't been amorous.   To be clear my room had a door that looked like it went through to an adjoining room ie it could be used as two rooms for a family - but the noise"
Great hotel with great facilities. Super nice rooms with super comfy beds. Really good food and really friendly staff. Pool was a great bonus. Secure parking is also available. Perfectly located close to harbour side. Would definitely stay again next time in Bristol.
"Went (as staff) to a school prom. The room was good. Food wasn't brilliant, and all the more popular food ran out. Drinks very expensive but that is to be expected (it is the same in any venues like this)"
Massive queue of people and only one person on reception at 5pm.  Not really clever from a 4 star hotel. Lots of staff around but no one that could check in.  This is one of the busiest times for checkin so a bit of planning would be expected.
"We stayed for a couple of nights to break up our journey back from Cornwall to Sheffield. We have stayed here a few times in the past, and were really impressed by the recent refurbishment. The bar, restaurant, and sitting room area are all more modern, light and food comfortable than before. The Miller & Carter restaurant is a great new edition & I am sure will create more revenue from guests & non residents alike.  Our room was a junior suite on the fourth floor which again had been refurbished. We have stayed in a similar room before & found the new furnishings & bed very comfortable & tastefully done. The bathroom was very modern but found it strange that there was nowhere to hang our towels resulting in them being hung over the bath & therefore replaced more often than I"
"I visit hotels quite often, mainly for holidays and like to post reviews. In my experience the larger chains tend to get much more critical reviews than do the smaller independents, probably because with more guest and external functions there is more ammunition for criticism! I have just returned from 2 nights at the Royal with my wife. It was a return for me to see Bristol many years after I was a student here. To clear up negatives first, a previous poster complained about lack of internet, that is not the case , it is easy to register for free use. External functions are clearly a problem, we were faced with a wedding which staff tried hard to control but it can be hard when guests can be so badly behaved. The function slightly marred our otherwise excellent dinner in Miller"
Make sure you ask when you book if they have any large events planned.  They didn’t tell me they had a prom (on a Tuesday night) and I had to endure the unacceptable noise levels late into the night.  Used to love this hotel but will be having second thoughts before booking again. 
Stayed on the 4th floor room 1453.   Pros  - Sauna/Steam room/Pool free to use  - shower was nice  - bed was comfortable  - AC worked  - Staff were friendly   Cons  - no free WiFi for guests in rooms? It’s 2019.. all hotels should be providing free WiFi.  - lighting in the room wasn’t great. Would have been nice to have one underneath the full length mirror.  - breakfast was average and expensive. Better to eat out in my opinion.   If you’re stuck of where to order for dinner I highly recommend Cedars Express (Lebanese cuisine)- food was exceptional and they even threw in a few freebies for me. 
I was at a conference here and we were all going out in the evening so I figured I’d change my hotel from the Premier Inn near the station to this one. My WiFi on my phone wasn’t brilliant so I queued at the reception desk. When I got there I was asked for photo ID in order to book in person. I thought being there in real life would make photo ID un-necessary but was told I’d be better off booking online as that didn’t require ID. WiFi was still a bit slow so I went back with photo ID a while later and spoke to a different employee. She said she’d just come off her break and it would take a long time to book with her and I’d be way better off booking online. Obviously I should have given up but it suited me to be able to stay there so I booked online. The room was clean and the
"Booked 5 rooms for the weekend for my daughter's hen do.  Fantastic hotel, great friendly staff.  We had up graded rooms.  Would recommend staying here as great central location,  right next to the cathedral.   Will go back again for a weekend away with family."
Stayed at this hotel for two nights for the football (Derby players and staff were in the hotel) we got an upgrade to a junior suite which was very large and well furnished.The hotel manages to retain its grandeur throughout the hotel and spa and is spotlessly clean. We didn't eat in hotel but did have a few drinks in the very comfortable bar area.The car park a the hotel is quite large and easy to use.The staff were all friendly and courteous.The hotel is well situated and an easy walk to shops and bars or restaurants.Hope to be back again next season.
"Where do I begin.... I’ve stayed with this hotel for 10 day stretches before, didn’t have an issue. I booked a suite too..  But now there was too many to count:  Lost my fiancé’s 4 luggages - they were placed in a wrong room and they couldn’t locate or remember where they were for over an hour. Quite unsettling.   I ordered room service - room service attendant was incredibly rude - giving me attitude over asking for things to be left out of my burger - on top of that, there was hair in my food,  a long blonde hair in my first bite. Spit it out and had them take it back. Upon check out though, gratuity was added after the fact for my other room service orders - when in fact I never left any gratuity due to how I was treated on the phone - I had them waive in the end after"
"Visited for 2 nights with family but this review relates only to my wife and myself. When we arrived in the room my wife sat on the desk chair and nearly toppled backwards as it had been left unlocked . Poor housekeeping  Room failed to cool so phoned reception. Asked for fan but none. Asked for window to be unlocked but no on health and safety grounds ( yet they managed it next day when someone could be bothered to come up). Offered room change but at 2330 not on.  Asked next morning re fan ( promised but never happened all day) and window - unlocked this time.   One lift of two at our end was out of order. On Sunday the queue for lift was hopeless so I went to front lifts and met a coup,e who had been there 10 minutes. Waited 10 myself as lifts continued to pass up and down"
"When I travel to Europe, I try to avoid cookie cutter “chain”hotels. This Marriott avoided the stereotype...a classic old hotel with class service and large comfortable rooms. Robe, slippers, in room coffee tea service, plus pleasant helpful staff. Breakfast in the downstairs restaurant isn’t inexpensive, but is very good."
"We stayed recently at the Marriott hotel. We actually only stayed one night and that was enough.  Whilst we were there, they had problems with their elevators, which was fine. We understand these things happen. But what was not ok, is that the floor we were staying on (I believe floor 4) the signs the hotel staff put up saying where the other lifts are were not clear. So we ended up walking around the top floor for the hotel for 10 minutes looking for other elevators whilst lugging two big suitcases.  The other issue we had, the bed was so so hard. I questioned at the time whether the floor could be more comfier.   But apart from that, everything else was fine!"
"Good location by the Harbor side however the service in the hotel is slow and poor. The rooms very basic/standard, the breakfast is good and the pool is OK. Had to go out and find dinner with young kids at 20.45!! As they failed to inform me that the restaurant was busy and I should book! Even though I had enquirered about kids menus hours before."
"Stayed for one night to attend medical school reunion. Room had been booked and paid for in full but reception had no record of this. Took thirty minutes before I was given the key to a distinctly third rate room: view of opaque glass roof below and walls of building, designed for someone disabled so no lid on WC and no way of stopping water going all over the floor when shower used.  I was by then very much in need of a cup of tea but there was no milk of any kind in the room and it took 20 minutes to be brought to me during which time I didn't feel I could have a shower to get ready for the evening.  Never able to use wifi throughout stay. There was a ""banquet"" in the Palm Court in the evening.  Vast quantity of butter was put on the table but no bread.  Eventually some was"
"Although expensive, it’s a nice treat for a romantic weekend away! Interior of bedroom and bathroom was beautiful and spacious. Not a long walk to the town for pubs, restaurants, events and clubs. Lacked activities in the hotel itself, such as pool tables to pass time rather than just drinking in their bar. Had a delicious continental breakfast - we had no problems and staff were very friendly 😊"
"With my heading, why no 5 stars? well, the hotel has now franchised its catering operation to Miller and Carter. We have always enjoyed eating at Miller and Carters before but the breakfast experience here was awful at best. The hotel itself is our first choice for visits to the Colston hall for music concerts (and occasionally comedy) and this time we were visiting to see Rod Stewart at Ashton Gate. The on site parking is convenient (but pricey for hotel guests and even dearer for non guests). The swimming pool is always easy to get into with no thermal shock of baltic sea temperatures. Location is very good for our visits and the bars across the road are a good choice. Our room this time was on the ground floor and very comfortable (despite a constant drone outside). Will we"
"We went for a function at the Marriot and everything apart from the building and its location has been complete underwhelming. The overal organisation was extremly chaotic. We had to wait for the pre ordered wine for 45 minutes, the food was dismal school dinner like with under cooked carrots and overboiled turnips, the bar run out of beer at 10pm and the worst was the service which seems untrained, rude and completely left to their own devices"
We spent two nights at this hotel during our recent visit to Bristol and enjoyed our stay as much as our previous ones.  The hotel is in an great location close to the Harbourside and Kings Street with its excellent pubs.  We were upgraded to a junior suite which was spacious and comfortable.  The refurbished restaurant looks great and we enjoyed excellent breakfasts there.
The Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel is in the perfect location for a visit to Bristol. It is literally next door to the Bristol Cathedral. It is an easy walk to University of Bristol and lots of interesting shops.   The hotel and our room were spotless (thank you housekeeping!). Breakfast offered everything you could possibly want. Service at the bar and restaurant were outstanding.  Congratulations to the manager of this property for a really well run hotel and staff who make it work seamlessly.
We stayed one night in a Deluxe room overlooking the cathedral. The room was quiet and well appointed but if you require turndown service and bathrobes you need to book a room the next level up. I found the bed quite hard but know this is always a subjective matter. Bathroom lighting is poor and I missed the illuminated make up mirror.  We had inclusive breakfast which was a standard traditional buffet heavily loaded with carbs and fat. A larger selection of healthy options and better quality food products would have been appreciated. There is a good range of facilities which we did not have the time to explore. Wifi was included in our rate as I signed up for the Marriott Rewards scheme. On site parking at £17/day is a great bonus and reasonable in Bristol.  Location is
"Stayed here last night, the room was adequate and clean, unfortunately my partner had a very bad nights sleep he said the bed was the most uncomfortable he had ever slept in, l did find it was quite a hard mattress but it didn't affect my nights sleep. breakfast was good, and much improved since our last stay here a few years ago, plenty of choice, the hotel is in a very good location"
"It is very well located next to the river in Bristol within easy walking distance of the Old Vic Theatre, the Cathedral is next door, the M-shed, the SS Great Britain. It has an underground car park with a reasonable capacity though the parking is £17/day. The room  was comfortable though robes were not provided until we asked. There is a spa though the service is quite poor; it took them days to respond to a request for treatments - and then they said there were none available. The breakfast buffet is comprehensive; but old fashioned in some respects (no muesli but lots of fired stuff and cornflakes). The restaurant is a steak bar; food is reasonable but service is on the poor side so one day they managed to only bring one of the two starters. The second followed after being"
"The building is really beautiful, as it's a heritage building, and the rooms are nice because they've been recently renovated, but the service is well below par. The staff try their best, and are friendly, but there is definitely a problem in the way the hotel is run. Their computers are frequently down, the lines at the front desk are really long (which suggests it's taking longer than it should to process each customer); it takes forever to put in an order at the restaurant, which often comes out wrong. You cannot sign your bill to your room after a meal. So many little things are wrong with the way it's run. I feel bad for the staff, as they end up getting the brunt of the customers' frustration. There was obviously a management problem there. My company puts me up there"
We were guest in the Marriott for a few days and were pleased to stay in the renovated wing. The windows can not be opened and the AC did not work properly. So warm. We were given an other room which was much better. We are always surprised that hotels of this stature offer additional WIFI. You actually have to pay to get Internet access...who does that? Reception was professional. The ( 2cnd) room was spacious and nice. Good bed! Breakfast very good. No service if seated in the bar area. At the bar itself the service was very good. Nice choice of open wines! We liked our sty!
We were in Bristol for a few day’s and stayed at the Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel. Professional reception. Nice rooms. Renovated facilities. Airconditioning was not working properly and windows could not open. Good comfortable bed! Super breakfast. Only green tea was missing. Good service except for the seats in the bar. Bar keepers are good and professional. Other staff in the bar not so. Good selection of wines by the glass!  We have enjoyed our stay. One complaint about WIFI: even as a guest you have to pay for WIFI. We think that this is outdayed and should be free of charge. Nevertheless we had a nice stay
"I stayed here with a friend for one night while we were at a concert. There is secure parking onsite, it costs £17 per 24 hours but we arrived in the afternoon and had parking until midnight the next day, even after we had checked out which I thought was good. All the staff we encountered were friendly, professional and helpful, our room was lovely with two double beds, no noise from the road facing window, proper blackout curtains and the most controllable heating/air con I have ever encountered. The bathroom was really great and there was a handy fridge in the cupboard. We didn’t have a breakfast so can’t comment on that but there are so many places to eat and drink nearby and the O2 academy was a very handy two minute walk away. All in all we will be back as soon as possible. "
"Have been using this hotel for over 30 years. This current trip was a birthday trip. We were shocked at the refurbishment. Gone are the beautiful pink marble bathrooms and the wonderful cocktail bar. Now everything is grey - grey walls, grey carpet, grey paint- so depressing. The new bar is vast, impersonal, and could not serve me a Margarita. Room service could not provide an omelette - ""only for breakfast""! Reception staff excellent  as ever. Staff answering room service and in bar were indifferent. Returned to hotel at 9pm and were obliged to park in a space for the disabled as there were no free spaces. Minimal information in room re hotel and tv services. We will be looking elsewhere in future for a hotel to stay in Bristol."
"We spent a weekend at this hotel, it was an excellent stay, quick and easy check in/ check out. Food at millar and cater in the hotel was brilliant, no complaints at all. Rooms very spacious and luxurious, very good sleep had by both myself and my partner. Beds very comfy, no noise at all and pillows were very nice. My only down point, my mrs has her nails done in the spa, but had to sit on a couch whilst the girl sat on the floor to do the nails. The spa is not 5 star. Would defo stay st this hotel again. "
"Had a fantastic stay at this hotel! Camilla on reception delivered outstanding service and was so polite and the Butler James!! However we visited Miller & Carter in the hotel and had disgusting customer service. The man firstly told us we had to order the same, then made a comment about us asking for mayo then also provided us with the wrong bill adding an additional £14 onto what we should of paid. He was rude and unpleasant and we felt very uncomfortable being served by him."
"All in all, very impressed. Fantastic customer service from the team. Lovely room, comfy bed. FREE WI-FI which is nice as it’s a 4G dead zone. Overly suspicious doorman when I came in at 1am stinking of cheap beer with a tray of chips. Some heroes don’t wear capes ✌🏻😂"
"This hotel just gets better, had a few issues with my membership being logged on the system but Jess sorted it for me before we arrived. Arrived a bit early but Matt looked after us and sorted the accommodation for around 4pm.  The room on the fourth floor was perfect and recently refurbished, although the sash windows could do with a bit of TLC as its a but dodgy keeping them open with a book.  The breakfast was very nice and the ambience in the bar was perfect. The hotel is very professionally run, very clean and parking on site. Only issue we had during the stay was the strangely unreliable lift nr the restaurant which would normally only respond to around forty button depressions.  All round a great hotel and very pleasant stay."
"Following your visit in 2018 when refurbishment activities were ongoing, we were invited to return at our convenience, for a complimentary overnight B&B experience.   This recent visit was exceptional inasmuch, the ambience and experience was absolutely brilliant.  The staff behaved in a very professional and caring manner and could not do enough for us both.  The room was spotless and included a complimentary bottle of merlot and a box of fudge....Lovely."
"  This hotel is wonderful, as soon as we arrived we were made to feel welcome.  The hotel is beautiful and very clean.  Our room was very comfortable and clean.  Breakfast was buffet style but was of a high standard.  We visited the pool and jacuzzi and had a very relaxing time.   We had a lovely meal at Miller and Carter which had fantastic service.   I would highly recommend this hotel."
"Great environment and location, spotless and luxurious room, helpful staff and underground parking (not free). However, eat out to avoid the lacklustre corporate dining experience which does not come up to the standard of the hotel. Breakfast was the usual buffet troughs of low grade cooked stuff and the continental selection was miserable guest house quality and selection. Charging for wi-fi in the 21st century in the room; it was free in the public bar !"
"Had a great stay here, brief but sweet.  The reception staff were lovely, friendly and considerate and took time to explain the amenities available during our stay. The restaurant had great service and a spacious vibrant atmosphere to it - service was good and even though we are vegetarian (and it’s a steakhouse!) we still had a good time.  It’s a charming old building and if you’re lucky you’ll get a view of the cathedral/college green. You can’t get a better location - it’s perfect for chilling on the green in the sun or hiking up park st to Clifton or exploring the dock area/galleries or the central area saint nics markets etc  It is an old hotel and the rooms are pretty dated - it could probably do with a refurbishment, but at the same time it’s absolutely fine - the bed was"
My wife and I stay here for our 17th wedding anniversary and I must say the staff made our stay extra special. Beautiful hotel and facilities. Highly recommend. We had the afternoon tea and it was lovely. Also had dinner in the hotel aswell and the food was cooked perfectly and the desserts are delightful. We used the swimming pool aswell. The hotel also offers spa treatments aswell. We stayed in the superior room in the royal wing which was perfect. Beautifully laid out with plenty of room. It was a great break.
The hotel was good for accommodation. The bed was small but acceptable. The bathroom was good and very well located.  The waiting for reception was unacceptable. There were insufficient staff at peak times.  The bar (run by Millers and Carter. had lots of staff but all busy sorting out glasses or making a coffee for someone outside the bar. We were the only people in the bar but still took 15 minutes to be served. Management need to sort this out!
"Oh dear oh dear, what have they done to this hotel?  It’s a Victorian building, you used to be greeted by a lobby with comfortable armchairs it looked genteel, warm and welcoming like one of those gentlemen’s clubs In Sherlock Holmes stories. It fitted with the architecture, it belonged. Now there is a vast cold looking open space.  As you stand facing the reception desk, on your right there is a bar and indoor neon lights - yes, really - advertising the company responsible for the “Steak Bar” which has replaced the old fashioned restaurant. Not quite sure who they are trying to attract with this, but I fear the hotel will not keep it’s old clientele and it will go down hill. The new arrangement is noisy and frankly down market.  The bedrooms have all been refurbished too since"
"A spectacular hotel that is clearly the place to stay when in Bristol, England. Beautiful appearance of outside provides an Old England feel (especially with the cathedral next door and the statue of Queen Victoria our front) but inside you will find a beautifully remodeled modern hotel. Rooms are beautiful and spacious. Hotel has all the perks and amenities. Staff is very helpful and friendly. The superb steakhouse restaurant also provides for a wonderful English breakfast in the morning. My five stars are well deserved. A must stay!!"
Great hotel with excellent sized clean rooms. I upgrading a suite which was worth every penny. Staff friendly and helpful. Located close to the city centre and harbour bustling harbour area. Parking onsite. 
"Stayed one night at this hotel and couldn't fault it, was a great location for the o2 academy where we were going for a concert and great for the nightlife afterwards. Parking onsite which was fab. Had a massage too which was great, wish we had more time to use pool and spa facilities. Ate in Miller and carter restaurant and food was lovely, lots of choice. Breakfast was good in the morning too. Good times too 7-11 and checkout at 12 which was good for us. All staff were friendly and helpful and our room was ready early which was a bonus for us. Room was a great size and had a nice view. Would definitely stay here again. "
"Stayed for 1 night for a theatre trip to the Hippodrome which was only 2 minutes walk away. We were able to check in early which was a great help. Check in quick and friendly. Big room on 2nd floor. Air con/heating very efficient. Secondary double glazing meant no traffic noise. Hotel very quiet at night. Room had what looked like a new bathroom with lovely fittings, plenty of toiletries, well-stocked tea/coffee making facilities.  Had an excellent evening meal in Miller and Carter restaurant. Good buffet breakfast. Also had drinks in the bar and lounge. Really lovely hotel, but the best thing about it was the staff. Without exception everyone we came across was friendly, helpful and provided really top class service. Thank you for a great stay. Strongly recommend."
Only stayed here one night so cant say too much about it.  I was attending a conference which was also held in the hotel.  The room the conference was in was exceptional - walls made from bath stone.  The room was on the lower ground and disabled friendly so lots of room.  I would have preferred a room with a view.  The staff were all very pleasant; friendly and professional.  Would stay again.
This hotel has a great feel to it - the staff are friendly - beautiful rooms - nice bar area - fantastic restaurant- and fabulous manager Josh who went above and beyond to help out with the menu to someone who was gluten free celiac- the food was very delicious and good value - would definitely eat there again - lovely ombience - I will definitely be returning to this beautiful hotel with adequate parking
"Lovely hotel in the best location. Excellent breakfast, very reasonable parking fee, nice view on Park Street. Rooms are well-sized and the staff very friendly. It was my second or third stay there and I do not see any alternative in the Bristol City Centre. There is a Radisson Blu close by but it does not have any character."
"The Hotel location was ideal for us to see Bristol right by the waterside, Easy walk to central Bristol  and  only 15 minutes to Clifton village As the hotel had 3 functions they gave us a quiet room on the 4th  floor The hotel and room were spotlessly clean and the Bar was always lively and staff in the bar very attentive and efficient Breakfast was very good in my view with hot buffet changed regularly always fresh and clean The only 2  gripes I had were the bed was to hard for my personal liking and staff in the restaurant were at times not very attentive and seemed uninterested in there jobs I would definitely use this hotel again..."
"Stayed for 3 nights at the Royal Marriott hotel Bristol, room was large just been redecorated and very clean, staff were all excellent and very helpful, spa needs a little redecorating but quite and we enjoyed mornings there after the excellent  breakfasts.carparking next to hotel in multi story easy access but subsidised £17 a 24hr period ."
After much research decided to book The Bristol Royal Marriott as required a base near to The Hippodrome.Found the hotel car hotel with ease but spaces are tight & luxury car owners like to park over 2 spaces??!! Hotel amazing....wonderful luxurious decor...stunning. Prior to arrival we requested a room with a bath tub. Received a prompt response that all would be done to accommodate that & so it was! Check in swift. They take a £50 holding deposit and from which deduct the £17 car park fee at check out. Rooms spacious and newly decorated. Bed very comfy. We ate elsewhere as reviews on the in-house Carter & Miller restaurant was poor. Hotel SO central SO MUCH choice would always dine out & about. Everything on your doorstep. Nearest attractions
"The Cons - We were greeted at the hotel by a cloud of smoke and a hustle to get in, where the designated smoking area seems to be directly in front of the main entrance (this continued throughout our stay) - When we got to reception, we were met by a brusk woman at the front desk who gave the impression that she neither liked her job or people in general all that much - When I asked if it would be possible to get a twin room (a pretty standard request IMHO), I was responded to with an exhale and then a rather exasperated explanation that this hotel doesn’t do twin beds, only family rooms and I would need to pay for the upgrade. Honestly, the delivery of this message made me adamant that I wouldn’t give them any more money - We went to the hotel bar for a glass of wine after a"
"Bristol Marriott really helped to make our trip really enjoyable. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Kids loved the pool so much so that we had to go again before the 12 noon checkout. My wife and I were also impressed with choice of steam room, sauna and jacuzzi. Room was spacious and immaculate. Hotel was a very short walk to ""we the curious"" a hands-on science experience or Hippodrome that we have visited before. I would like to thank staff with special thanks to Borja Serrano for the happy memories of this short trip. "
Visiting grandson student. Good location next to Bristol Cathedral and Harbour area. Lovely rooms. Service good and underground parking. Fee if you are not a member or have not upgraded. Breakfast good. Hope to return in July for Grandson’s graduation. Recommended.
"This is a fabulous hotel - clean, comfortable, excellent service, facilities, location and accomdation. Would highly recommend it. We stayed for one night and were upgraded on arrival to a superior room with complimentary parking. Also received a box of truffles as it was International Womems Day"
"Stay here regularly for business and not yet had a stay where i was satisfied yet. Considering the premium charged this hotel seriously lacks the service required  The pool was put of commission for weeks. The restaurant refused service at 8pm one evening as they had a group of 14 to serve, even tho they have capacity for 100. The internet is regularly offline making business calls to the USA on skype impossible , and finally the rewards program never updates my stays despite multiple emails etc etc  Will be switching stays to the Bristol hotel in the future that seem to have got it right and at a better price  Very disappointed "
"This is a lovely hotel with great staff  across the board. The receptionists, porters, managers, bar staff and breakfast staff are great to deal with. The restaurant has been leased out to a steakhouse and I think they've done a great job too.  Lovely pool, gym & newly decorated rooms (the rooms were re-done in the last year and they're great).   Hotel is very central and sits alongside college green, fenced in by two lovely old buildings and there are many lovely places to eat in walking distance."
This Is a busy hotel which means you wait at reception and you wait for lifts. My room had no fire safety information on the door or any I could find apart from generic paragraphs in the room info pack. This made me feel nervous on the fourth floor. No heated towel rails so damp towels over night . One teabag  in the room but housekeeping quickly sent up more on request. Minimal toiletries. The overall feel wasn't luxurious but it was functional. Eating in Miller and Carter restaurant wasn't a good experience.  Checking out wasn't a good experience either as the restaurant bill couldn't be substantiated .The restaurant is a franchise separate to the hotel and communication between the two seems poor. Next time I visit Bristol I will be trying somewhere different.
"Stayed for one night midweek for a birthday celebration on a room only basis.  On arrival, found we had received an upgrade to a superior room, which was very nice. Another pleasant surprise on entering our room was a welcome card with a half bottle of white wine and a tin of fudge.  Bathrobes and slippers as well. Another plus was our room was on the 3rd floor with views overlooking the water and Watershed area, across to the Bristol Hotel and floating harbour. The hotel has been redecorated over the last year, so the room was clean and in excellent condition.  The bathroom contained a large shower, but no bath.  Only negative, was the light could be brighter for shaving.   Finding the car park entrance was fun, drove around three times and had to call in the end to find out"
"Great location and a nice property, as you would expect from a Marriott. The interrior is grand and there are some good event spaces upstairs. The main event room is beautiful. The bedrooms are spacious and well appointed. It's a big hotel and there was quite a walk to my room which I enjoyed but you need to be wary if you don't like walking. The staff that I met were all pleasant and helpful.   The problem is that you get charged for parking and charged if you want to use the wifi. I haven't had the latter issue in years, wifi comes as standard usually. With the parking charge (reduced to £17!) being your first interaction with the hotel the whole thing leaves you feeling like you're the victim of a shakedown rather than the valued guest of a premium hotel for which you've"
Lovely hotel in a great location but yet again a cold breakfast which they did nothing to remedy and refused to refund saying that the restaurant is not owned by the hotel so they cannot.  Eventually managed to get them to refund my car parking as compensation but did not feel that adequate for two breakfasts we could not eat.
"We spent a pre booked night at this hotel.  It is a great location with fine bedrooms and a level of grandeur.  We were disappointed on 2 counts.  We had booked the hotel because it includes a swimming pool.  We learn that the hotel pool has not been in use for several weeks.  If we had been told this at the time of reserving we would have booked elsewhere.  We were given a discount when we complained.  But that misses the point. Secondly we had planned an anniversary dinner in the restaurant.  We were not able to do so, because the restaurant was fully booked. We compensated with an excellent afternoon tea.  Again not part of our plan.  This is an expensive hotel and it failed to give us value for money."
"Having stayed in Bristol a few times before, we thought we would stay in the Marriott Royal as it is a grand, characterful building with a pool, sauna and spa treatments available.  We stayed on a Saturday night and planned to  use the facilities after breakfast.  However, the pool was closed (not on their website or communicated to us during booking) and there are no spa treatments available on Sundays.  The breakfast was average, we have had better in the Premier Inn and the parking (£17 for one night) is expensive. On a positive note, the room was clean and comfortable and the location on College Green was good for us."
"I booked the Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel for a recent gig at the O2 Academy which is only a two minute walk away. Check in was easy and effortless and we were quickly in our room. The room was nice and had everything that was expected and was extremely clean, even the date stickers on the bed sheets of when they were washed. A nice touch having a bottle of water with the beverage making facilities. We were disappointed that the swimming pool wasn't in use during our visit as this was one of the main reasons we had booked this hotel on this visit. We had breakfast in the restaurant which was definitely worth the price and the choice was amazing, certainly a breakfast to set you up for the day. Overall we had a good stay but personally for the money you pay, you really don't get"
We stayed her over our wedding weekend (the wedding happened elsewhere).  we booked a suite and this had an attached separate living room. The room was high quality and overall we couldn't fault the hotel.
"We have stayed in this hotel on numerous occasions since 2006. It's good to see that there has been an investment for a refurbishment of the hotel, however disappointing for us was that the baths have been removed in many of the rooms. The staff in this hotel are excellent and the lady on reception managed to find a room with a bath.  Another change not particularly to our liking was the replacement of the hotel restaurant with a Miller and Carter steakhouse where breakfast is served. We are far from vegetarians but been surrounded with pictures, signs and aprons that glorify eating steak was a bit much at breakfast. We were not impressed with the breakfast offerings of tinned fruit with very little fresh fruit available. The only bread available was sliced loaves for toasting."
"Our recent stay (Sunday 17th Feb- Tuesday 19th Feb) was the most disappointing hotel experience we have had for some years. We had decided to book somewhere a little more 'upmarket' from our usual Premier Inns having seen a deal via booking.com. We won't be back to a Marriott in a hurry though.  The room seemed decent enough on the face of it and our late check in was facilitated ok. No complimentary bottle of mineral water to be found in the room which you might expect from a hotel charging around £130+ per night.  However, things got worse. There was a weird persistent drone noise (Like a washing machine at full spin and a very intrusive noise) which continued the whole of our stay which kept my wife and I awake all night. More of that later.  In the morning my wife went for a"
"So I had such a horrific experience at this hotel it can’t be the usual otherwise I don’t see how they would be open!   I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. When I checked in I was given room 1276. On the second day I received a letter asking me to come to reception, which I did, and I was informed some maintenance was required on the room and asked if I could move rooms. I informed the lady at reception that this was inconvenient as I had a lot of work to do and that I would request they wait on the maintenance or simply work around my belongings.   I returned to the hotel on the third night to find that my room key didn’t work, on returning to reception I was informed that the hotel had ignored my request and moved my belongings to a different room, and that someone else had"
"The Royal is located in the centre of Bristol. Close to the Hippodrome, Aquarium and a variety of restaurants and bars.   Hotel was easy to find and the room was ideal and clean.  The bar/restaurant within the hotel is Miller and Carter (breakfast buffet if you opt for it).   Hotel receptionist very friendly- even had a free room upgrade and free parking which was a great treat and will use again. "
"Stayed at the hotel on the wekend. There was a mistake on the booking (my end), I was supposed to be there friday at 4pm but turned up saturday the receptionist was very friendly and helpful and managed to find me and my partner a room for the night on the mezzanine floor. We stayed for one night and breakfast in the morning, Which was thrown in for free  ( maybe the felt sorry for us), Which we appreciated very much a selction of continental and full english, ceral and fruit all good quality and fresh.  The room was very clean and a good size. Lots of towels nice smelling toiletries. Facelities to make tea or coffee. The reception of the hotel is very grand and has a good looking interior, a pleasent aroma of lemons wafts around the building where ever you go. We parked in the"
"Having been a regular to this hotel for the last 15 years I am saddened to think that this is likely to be my last stay based on our experiences over the last two days.   Restaurant- busy , but booked in advance. If we had not I think I would have been upset at not being able to eat in the hotel restaurant if a paying resident at the hotel. We saw a few people turned away during our meal. Food was ok , starter very poor did not help that the poor waitress chucked our garlic bread on the floor. Had our hungry 5 year old with us , so by the time our bread arrived we had finished the very small sharing board. I was not impressed as a guest to hear the staff and management having a heated discussion regarding another customers disputed drinks bill. Completely unacceptable it was"
Had a great stay here with friendly welcoming staff! Breakfast could have been prepared better though as arrived cold. But other than that all was well in regards to service and the room was clean and comfortable.
"My wife and I recently stayed in this hotel for a couple of days to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  I had mentioned in the booking that it was a special occasion and from the moment we arrived the staff were extremely kind. They had clearly noted that it was a special occasion and went out of their way to make our stay memorable. The room was lovely, spacious and comfortable. The hotel is in a great location with lots of excellent bars and restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel.  Overall, you may pay a little more to stay here than in a budget hotel, but the location is superb and the staff were friendly, professional and incredibly kind; the quality of the hotel shone through in the attitude of the people who worked there. I would definitely recommend staying"
"Tried out the newly renovated Royal Superior Room.  Overall it was an enjoyable stay, the room was recently renovated but lacked the bath as available in the lower cost deluxe rooms.  The recent renovation had modernised the room but needs snagging.  Broken door latch, cupboard doors not closing as catching on lower doors, tv kept going unresponsive and freezing (system not the signal) only 4 random Nespresso coffee pods for 2 people, shame about the bath but overall a nice room with a mini fridge but would never book this over a deluxe room again due to lack of bath, only noticeable difference was a small bottle of red wine, Nespresso machine and a desk.  Corridors had smoke alarms still taped over and emergency keys left in the emergency door buttons.   Breakfast in the new"
"I stayed in this hotel for one night on the 1st of February with my husband and parents due to our flight being cancelled. The check in at the hotel was simple / quick and stress free with friendly staff.   Both the swimming pool and hot tub were out of order much to our disappointment, although we were able to use the Sauna and Steam room.   The room itself, was located on the ground floor, and seemed as if it was a room that was not used very often. Despite the high number of extra guests in the hotel, there were dirty socks left in the wardrobe as well as a half-eaten cake. The bed, shower and room itself was fine, though could do with some modernisation (carpets in the hall).  We did use room service, and everything was as expected, professional and prompt and reasonably"
"For the price they charge I think staying somewhere else is better. I must say the rooms were good and clean. But thats about it. 1. One of the lift to bedrooms did not work so that means you wait for ever to get to your room. 2. The pool was out of action and it did no reflect on my price of booking. 3. The breakfast menu was limited, I have seen better menu in cheaper hotels. 4. You had to queue for breakfast even though there were empty tables because the hotel did not bother to put extra staff for sitting guests. 5. If you want espresso with breakfast it is extra not part of breakfast. 6. The front desk lacks trained staff as they had tough time checking me out.  I gave them a feedback and they said they will refund 20% of my stay which I accepted. But I feel that is not"
"Stayed here for a friend's 50th birthday, initial parking was a pain as spaces are tight and there are some inconsiderate people parking (who should be charged double for blocking spaces) but eventually found spaces three levels down.   Walking to the hotel from the car park was a little confusing as was a distinct lack of signs whilst some corridors were being painted. Parking prices are extortionate @£17 a night whilst staying there... Certainly NOT appealing!!... (Captive audience syndrome - make them pay over the odds because you can).  Check-in was a bit slow and they require a £50 deposit on the room which is pretty much their way of holding your money for payment for parking, refund of the balance is returned to your card  on departure. Even though my car registration was"
"Stayed here for one night and chose this hotel purely for the location as we were going to a show at the hippodrome. We parked in the hotel car park and it’s very obvious the steps and corridors are being decorated. There were dirty dust sheets all over the floors and only ‘wet paint’ signs at the top by the hotel entrance,not as you enter from the car park . Not a great first impression..At reception we had to wait a long time to check in and were surprised we had to pay a £50 deposit. The lift is very slow and it doesn’t help when you have to wait For the next one because the house keepers are in there with their big trolleys. Our room was a long way from the lift and although it had recently been refurbished was very dark. The bathroom was very nice , clean and modern."
Very attentive staff. Really great restaurant. Comfy bed and spacious room.  However we really enjoyed our 2 days there. Staff kept our luggage as we arrived earlier and really did attend to our needs . Would definitely stay there again.
